"Auto loan AUTO INSURANCE PREMIUM REIMBURSEMENT HAS RUINED MY PERSONAL AND BUSINESS CREDIT SCORES or reasonable working capital financing. The auto insurance coverage period in question is XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX ( same time frame as the account fraud ) and I did not get my refund until XXXX... which is almost 3 years later to finally get my initial check. Here is the series of events that ruined my credit : a. I sent Well Fargo proof of insurance in XX/XX/XXXX and I did not get my check until the first week of XX/XX/XXXX why would it take another 2 3 month on top of initially waiting almost 3 years b. So, I made the deposit and then c. a stop payment was placed on the check ( no explanation for why and no apology for one of many inconveniences ) and I was charged a {$30.00} stop payment fee. The check amount was for {$1500.00}. So a total of {$1600.00} was debited from my account. 
d. So then I told XXXX XXXX from Wells Fargo Dealer Services, I received the replacement check on XX/XX/XXXX and made the deposit today which means I won't be able to make the payment until the check clears on Friday XX/XX/XXXX or Monday XX/XX/XXXX ; e. So, of course, my credit score has been impacted by this going back to XXXX which is my point about collateral damage resulting in lower credit scores leading to predatory loans and is another part of why my business is suffering. This money was going to be used to catch up on my mortgage that I am already 2 months behind on and I will incur additional late payment fees. 
f. Of course, my reaction was disbelief as to why would a stop payment be placed on a check that I clearly provided to you a copy of proof of insurance certificate from my insurance company. 

So now my credit score has been damaged and I was denied a mortgage modification and was given a forbearance plan instead - due to everything that Wells Fargo has put me through with the account fraud and resulting collateral damages and especially the collateral damages from 8 + month long secret biased one sided investigation. So my credit score needs to be repaired.

"In the year XX/XX/XXXX, I was managing two small businesses ( XXXX and XXXX ). XXXX was providing on line computer support and XXXX XXXX was used for purchasing jewelry items through PayPal. After some time, PayPal sent me collection letters for {$780.00} for XXXX. I have tried to reach PayPal several times by Phone, Inter Office emails and even Certified Letters but I could not resolve the issues. 
In a call to PayPal on XX/XX/XXXX to their Dispute Dept. with XXXX, I was told that the Balance Due is only {$240.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an e-mail statement that amount due is {$460.00}. ( See Exhibit B, Scan XXXX ).

On XX/XX/XXXX sent a Certified mail to PayPal legal Dept. I received an e-mail response on XX/XX/XXXX. ( See Exhibit B, Scan XXXX ) explaining Debt Amount of {$780.00}. Surprisingly if you added those amounts, it come out to be {$780.00}. 
On XX/XX/XXXX PayPal sent me an email in response to my Second Certified letter, ( See Exhibit B Scan XXXX ) to call PayPal to resolve issues. In every call I spoke to different depts. and different people, every one giving different answers. No one would confirm that I have spoken to someone else before. I have sent several inter office emails for which I received an automated response for receiving email without any follow up. 
Previously, I have received several emails informing me that PayPal is withdrawing their money request. In their emails, there is no Case ID or transaction information. Also I have discovered some duplicate transactions showing negligence on part of PayPal. Even after realizing their mistakes amount due is always {$780.00} and it would not change. 
After many phone calls PayPal provided me with access to XXXX XXXX account I have discovered many unauthorized money transfers and several transactions still on hold in their records. ( See Exhibit A and its summary ). These transactions are from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. Access to XXXX account was not granted. 
After discussion with several PayPal Dept., I could not get any explanation on phone, by email or hard copy. My businesses have suffered losses and ending up closed because of these irregularities. It has affected my Credit also. I request your help in resolving this case. Thank you.

"recently filed Chapter XXXX as I had got behind with my bills and my hours were cut back at work due to the Covid 19 Pandemic. I did not file on my mortgage company for obvious reasons. When I went on line to make a payment I found I was locked out of my account because of the bankruptcy. I called them and explained that i had not filed on them and was told I would need to mail in a payment and that they could not even talk to me without permission from my lawyer. I had my lawyer send them a form giving said permission on XX/XX/XXXX He received an email from them requesting the account number associated with my mortgage and he sent them the needed information the same day. In the mean time I sent a check for my XXXX payment in the form of a metered mail envelope that my secretary hand delivered to the post office.

"I have been a customer of Wells Fargo since XXXX having recently closed my bank accounts due to these ongoing issues. I procured my WF credit card in XXXX and it has been down hill since then. Wells Fargo is mismanaging my credit card and you need to know this. Payments have disappeared, money has not been credited to account, automatic payment form has a forged signature, and credit line changed without contact, and more. This mismanagement is so egregious that their own employees have agreed that there has been improper handling of this account. 

I have been dealing with issues on the credit card for three years and nothing has been resolved. Talked with three different people in executive office, numerous branch officials, and countless phone customer service agents. This led me to close accounts with WF to never bank there again.

"I purchased a clearance mattress from Mattress Firm, which they offered financing for. When I applied for this loan, I was under the impression, rightly or wrongly, that I was applying for an installment loan, or some other closed line of credit, but it was opened as a credit card with Synchrony Bank. I was never provided a Regulation CC disclosure during the process.

"On XX/XX/XXXX ( before my payment due date ) I called in to CitiBank to see if they had any available programs in reference to Coronavirus or COVID19. I was transferred around until I landed on an agent that supposedly could help. I explicitly stated that I could pay my regular bill at the time. I was simply calling in to see if they had any deferment programs so that i could save my cash to use for groceries and such. The agent said she understood and offered to defer my payments and cancel my autopay on both of my accounts. I gladly accepted. 

A few days later I received an email that I had missed a payment. I checked my app and was shown that both of my accounts were labelled as past due, with a late fee attached. I called in immediately to rectify the situation. The first agent I spoke with said that there was no program in place, that they had only received communication of possible programs upcoming, and so the previous representative had spoken in error. I requested a supervisor. Again was told that the initial representative was wrong and there was nothing they could do about it. At this point, I was unworried about the deferred payment but the late fee and the impact on my credit score for having 2 accounts showing a missed payment. I have no missed payments on my credit history. I was told by the supervisor that I shouldn't worry about it, a lot of people are going through things right now and they're sure it will all be handled, just give it time. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the late fee on my Citi DoubleCash card was refunded. I noted on XX/XX/XXXX that the late fee was still showing on my Citi American Airline AAdvantage card. I called in at XXXX and after explaining the situation to the initial rep, was transferred to a supervisor. He told me that they would not remove the late fee and there was nothing he could do about it. I explained again, in detail, the situation that led to the late fee in the first place : That I had the funds to make the payments but was erroneously advised by a representative of CitiBank that my payments were deferred and so was under the false understanding that I did not have to make the payment. He still refused to remove the late fee. 

At this time I am requesting the removal of the late fee and the assurance that the ( 2 ) missed  payments will not show on my credit report as the late payment was due to professional negligence and false information provided by a Citi representative/employee, with me, as the consumer, relying on their expertise to guide my payment decision.",Credit card or prepaid card,"CITIBANK, N.A.",1
"During the months of XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX. We received a letter from XXXX XXXX sending a demand for payment on the second mortgage loan that was charged off in XX/XX/XXXX. The letter referenced XXXX XXXX was collecting the debt for PHH mortgage company who was listed as the servicer for the loan. 
Since XXXX couldn't provide any documentation that actually provided that PHH Mortgage was the actual servicer of the second mortgage loan, I ask for additional information from XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from XXXX and they reference they were in receipt of my dispute with them and they wouldn't be providing any more written correspondence or documents. See a copy of the attached email from XXXX. 
I kept requesting and no information was provided by XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a demand letter from XXXX and they continued to reference PHH mortgage as the client they are collecting the debt. see attached letter.

"During my stay in XXXX ( as indicated in my passport and the attached immigration form XXXX ) I was the subject of a fraudulent event on XX/XX/XXXX, when a thief opened a VISA XXXX card ( apparently in my name, since I never received any statement from XXXX ), and the subject made a purchase of around {$1400.00} USD with an address that does not belong to me. It is clear that the thief took advantage of COMENITY CAPITAL BANK and XXXX 's systems controls. 
By simply doing an INSTANCHEK on the Web, this could have been easily avoided. Also, by cross checking my mail address with other providers, for example my internet services, cell phone or credit card to realize that Ive never lived at the address that the offender used for this fraud, not even close, nor have I ever had that address in my life. ( Bills attached ) I found out about the fraudulent act when, by chance, the XXXX XXXX app informed me about the closure of an account due to non-payment in XX/XX/XXXX of this year. 
This VISA XXXX has never belonged to me. I Have always had an excellent credit history. So, in the midst of the pandemic, I called the bank and reported the fraud, and then did the same with all the credit bureaus and froze my credit. 
When I called the bank, Ms. XXXX from fraud operations refused to give me any more information other than that the address linked to that XXXX account was not the one I was giving her, but a completely different one. She said it was something like on the XXXX or so, but refused to tell me the complete address. 
( Later, upon reviewing my Experian record, I was able to see that fake address was that in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, FL. ) Ms. XXXX asked me for an address where to send the required information to evaluate my case, as I mentioned I did not permanently reside in the United States and my activity is traveling 70 % of my time between XXXX and XXXX XXXX as XXXX of my company. I proposed my daughters address ( who is attending her Master at UM in XXXX XXXX and is a US citizen with a permanent residency in Florida ). 
For all of that, she would be able to receive and send any requests from the bank to any destination without any problems and therefore solve any issues. 

That is why the address XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX FL XXXX appears in my file since XX/XX/XXXX. See XXXX report when my current address is registered since XX/XX/XXXX in the same report. 

I find the banks behavior very strange, modifying an address by phone without any physical verification, PHOTO ID via FAX, or electronically SCANNED via email. 

To my surprise, contrary to sending me an information kit and procedure on how to report my dispute, I was informed by my daughter that she received two statements by the bank, requesting to pay the scam, What is even worse, they claim in the letter they sent me that they have already resolved that there is no evidence of fraud based on the information I have supposedly provided, when I actually had only given them my daughter 's address until now. 

Since valuable information was not taken or obtained to resolve this case, Im providing the bank with each and every piece of evidence and records to collaborate with the investigation, assuming that there is no ill intent but task overload due to Covid-19.

After having complied with reporting to all Government Agencies such as FTC, CFPB, Police Department and CBB, and having verified on the Equifax website that I was a victim of IDT in the aforementioned data breach, I can only expect a quick and positive resolution by Comenity Capital Bank in order to close the case.",Credit card or prepaid card,Alliance Data Card Services,1

That was the last document according to their paperwork and numerous phone calls that I needed to provide them to have completed step 1 and to receive our initial check back from them so I can pay the contractor. I called on XXXX to find out why it was not showing up on the website. I was informed their website had been down and they didn't receive it. There was no effort on their part to inform me about the website being down. This directly delayed a check being issued back to us from them.

I called today XXXX after I saw on the website that the contract had been reviewed only to be informed they now needed a blue print.

A Subsidiary of Encore Capital Group, it has been involved in more than 300 federal lawsuits. It has violated TCPA, FDCPA, FCRA laws numerous times. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has sued and demanded strict policies on Midland Funding and Parent company Encore Capital for : i. Illegal collection activities ii. CFPB specifically found that encore capital bought debts that they knew or should have known were inaccurate or outside the statute of limitations. 
iii. Also found that they bought debts, that where they knew or should have known that the underlying documents or records were inaccurate. 

iv. Made misrepresentation to consumers that their accounts have been reviewed by an attorney and that a lawsuit will be brought up with failure to pay v. Misled consumers to agreeing for auto-dialed calls to their cellphones causing spam harassment violating the Telephone Consumer Protection Act ( TCPA Laws ) vi. They have filed lawsuits with no intention to prove if the consumer contested it vii. Have filed misleading affidavits in their lawsuits against consumers ; some were even made up viii. Have misled consumers and courts by stating that an undisputed debt is presumed to be valid under debt collection laws, when in fact the Federal Laws governing debt collection state no such thing.

Today XX/XX/2019 I received a letter from the bank saying they denied again because I have to resolve the issue with the merchant, when I specifically told them the merchant denied to refund me the money.

"In XX/XX/2019, USAA notified me via mail that my checking account was at risk of being closed because they had determined that I had been using the personal checking account for business activity. I immediately called USAA to address the matter. When I reached a representative I was told that the reason for the notice was due to deposits that had been made into the checking account in the name of a business. When I promptly told the employee that I had never received any checks in the name of a business he tried to look for other reasons. The employee then stated that I had made wire transfers and when asked for the reason of the wire transfer, I had replied "" inventory purchase. '' According to the employee, this was the reason my checking account was at risk of being closed. However, if I ceased this activity, I was told there would be no issue. Further, the employee said that I could still make wire transfers and when asked for the purpose of the transfer simply state something that is unrelated to anything that could be construed as business. 

Further, I wanted to make sure from the employee that my checking account would never be closed without giving me proper notice as such a sudden closure would inevitably cause financial stress and hardship. The employee assured me that USAA would never close my account without notifying me in advance. 

I continued using my checking account as directed ( not for business purposes ).  Whenever I made wire transfers and was asked for the reason I was always able to provide a reason that was unrelated to business. Further, no money was ever deposited into my account in the name of a business. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a check in the mail with the balance of what had been in my checking account and a one line memo on it that stated "" close account ending in xxxx. '' The check was dated XX/XX/XXXX. I immediately reached out to USAA for an explanation. They had closed my account on XX/XX/XXXX ( 5 days before I received the check or had any idea that the account had been closed ). There was no advance notification as I had been assured there would be if this event were to ever occur. I was completely panicked as my employer 's check was due to be sent the next day ( XX/XX/XXXX ). Even more worrisome was the fact that my car payment ( along with several other payments that are set-up for automatic withdrawal from my checking account ) had not gone through. Therefore, I was late on payments. Checks that I had written days before the account closure did not go through. XXXX transfers that I had made between XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX did not go through. Even worse, I have credit card bills due that I have no means to pay before the statements close because they were always paid by this one checking account that I had. To sum it up, I was in financial XXXX. 

When I requested bank statements from USAA leading up to the account closure in an effort to find out what other automatic payments I had set-up and what checks I wrote did go through, I was initially told I could not have them because I no longer had an account with them. After escalating the matter, I finally got past months statements but not the most important one ( XX/XX/XXXX ). XX/XX/XXXX, the days leading up to the account closure, would be crucial to me knowing what payments did or did not make it through for the financial obligations that I have ( credit cards, checks, auto payments, electric bill, etc ). I was told this statement was not available and will only be available when the full statement cycle ends ( didn't my cycle end when they closed my account? ).

No employee at USAA has been able to provide ANY information on what "" business activity '' my account was used for since the notice that I received in XX/XX/XXXX. I have been forced to endure tremendous stress and financial hardship as a result of the checking account being closed without any notice whatsoever. This kind of treatment from a financial institution is troubling to say the least and unlawful from a consumer protection standpoint.

"On XX/XX/XXXX I checked my business account checking balance. I had enough I thought to buy some gas and pay for parking until a deposit came in on Friday XX/XX/19. In any case I was not too worried since I believed I had opted to not have any OD 's paid. It turns out that my balance was quite low and my monthly maintenance fee hit on XX/XX/19 which zeroed my balance. On XX/XX/19, I was traveling around and using my debit card for that account to pay for parking. 

I used the card 4 times on XX/XX/19 and paid for parking in the following amounts : {$1.00} {$1.00} {$1.00} {$1.00} Since I believed my card would reject if there were no available funds I was not worried. I could then use the business credit card or a personal credit or debit card to pay for parking instead of the business debit card. However, the charges went through. 

On Friday XX/XX/19 I went into a local branch to move funds from my business to personal account and to discuss the overdraft charges since I had received an email notice about that. 

With my other bank accounts I don't need to go into the branch to move money but Capital One Bank does not yet allow me to move funds from my business to personal accounts electronically without using a third party service like XXXX. 

When I addressed the overdraft issue at the branch with the teller ( XXXX ) at the XXXX, Maryland branch she told me that my account is set to pay all overdrafts.

She then went to the Manager of the branch, Mrs. XXXX who told her there was nothing she could do because her system shows that all overdrafts are to be paid. Since I don't recall ever overdrawing this account, this situation had not come up before. 

In any case, I was charged {$35.00} for each overdraft on the same day. A total of {$140.00} in overdraft fees for my account being overdrawn by a total of {$5.00}.

"Citibank Yanks {$1600.00} in Costco Rewards Points and Closes Visa Card Account Without Warning After years of paying my Citibank Costco Visa on time and in full EVERY month, Citibank closed my credit card account WITHOUT WARNING several days ago and took the {$1600.00} Costco rewards points my husband and I had accumulated over the past year by spending tens of thousands of dollars at Costco. They said they closed the account because the payment I made for the most recent bill failed to process due to insufficient funds. I explained to both Citibank AND Costco that I was in XXXX for work when I scheduled this payment, and that, due to Internet access  restrictions in XXXX, I was not able to view the bank account balance to confirm that the account contained sufficient funds to pay the bill in full. However, as soon as I returned to the US and received a notice about the failed payment, I paid the bill immediately, in full, from a different bank account. 

After trying to use the Visa card this past weekend and having transactions declined, I called Citibank customer service to find out what was going on. They said the account had been terminated, the {$1600.00} Costco rewards points were now no longer in existence, and there was nothing they could do since THEY closed the account. Citibank said they had sent me a letter explaining that the account would be cancelled. We never received any letter. When I asked them on the phone to tell me why the account was cancelled, they were unable to provide a reason.

"This is the letter of dispute I sent to JPMorganChase : XX/XX/2019 XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NJ. XXXX Account # XXXX XXXX XXXX   XXXX JPMorgan Chase Bank Executive Offices XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, OH XXXX Dear Sir or Madam : I am writing to dispute the fact that I applied for a XXXX XXXX XXXX offer ( XXXX bonus miles + {$250.00} statement credit ) and was given a totally different one ( XXXX bonus miles after spending {$2000.00} on purchases in the first 3 months ). 
I applied for the card online on XX/XX/2019. I was instantly approved with a credit line of {$11000.00}. 
Since you record all your customer calls, you will be able to verify that in the following days I called and was given reassurance that I had correctly applied to the XXXX + {$250.00} offer. 

On XX/XX/2019, XXXX XXXX, I called your Customer Service. After explaining that I had not been given the offer, the CS agent reiterated the fact that XXXX had the offer but that he did not know why it had not been honored. He indicated that he could file a complaint on our behalf, which we asked him to do. He informed us that it would take about 14 business days for us to get a reply. After filing it, we asked him to transfer our call to a supervisor, which he politely did. 
XXXX, who identified herself as a supervisor, answered the call. She immediately contradicted her CS agent and told us that XXXX had no such offer, but that it was XXXX XXXX who was offering such a deal. In the course of the conversation, our call was disconnected. I called again and this time, I spoke to XXXX, another CS supervisor. She contradicted what XXXX had told us and insisted that we had applied to the XXXX XXXX XXXX which was offering XXXX after {$2000.00}. At numerous times during our conversation, I repeated that I had not applied for the XXXX {$2000.00} offer, and that the XXXX + {$250.00} credit offer appeared in the process of us searching for airline tickets, which was what caught our attention. 
XXXX then told me we were given the XXXX {$2000.00} offer and there was nothing we could do about it. I asked her how was it possible that I was given a card I had not applied for without first informing me of that fact. I wasnt notified at anytime during the approval process that I was only being approved for the XXXX {$2000.00} offer and not the XXXX {$250.00} credit offer which I had applied for. We were not given the option to approve or decline. 
I asked XXXX to provide me with the contact information of the Complaint Department, which was above her, and she denied me the information telling me that there was no department higher than her and that all she could do was offer me what the first CS agent had offered us. I went on the inform XXXX that a complaint had already been submitted. 
On XX/XX/2019, I again called your CS department and I was basically told the same as before, but this time the CS agent specifically said that we had not been approved for the XXXX + {$250.00} credit offer and that was the reason why we were given the card with the XXXX {$2000.00} offer instead. Once again, I inquired why was this done without prior notification and without our approval. It was your obligation to inform us that we did not qualify for the XXXX + {$250.00} credit offer and then offer us the XXXX {$2000.00} offer and allow us the choice to accept or decline. I also asked the CS agent to give me the information to the Complaint Department and she refused to provide the information, that if we wanted to speak to a CS supervisor she would transfer my call but otherwise she wasnt giving me the information I requested. 
Finally, she did transfer me to a CS supervisor, who apologized for the hard time I was given. She repeated what the CS agent had told me about not qualifying for the offer we applied for and graciously gave me the information I requested in order to submit my complaint to your executive offices. 
I have enclosed copies of the website images of the offer we applied for and highlighted the statement : {$250.00} Statement Credit This product is not available to either ( i ) current Cardmember of this credit card, or ( ii ) previous Cardmembers of this credit card who received a new Cardmembers bonus for this credit card within the last 24 months.

"On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  CST, I received an email from Discover  telling me that they closed my credit account. I was confused and concerned. I was a Discover cardholder since XXXX and have never been late on a payment. 

On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  CST, I called the number listed on the email to find out exactly why my account was closed and to try to get the decision reversed based on my length of account and perfect payment history. I spoke to a representative in Utah who told me that they closed my account due to non-use, which was the main factor. The last time I made a payment to pay my card off in full was XX/XX/XXXX, so it hadn't been used in 7 months. I pleaded with the representative and reminded them about my history with the bank and never missing a payment. The representative was apathetic and told me that they can't reverse the decision. I explained that there have been several periods during the last 12 years where I have gone much longer without any card use and never had this happen before. The representative would only say that their non-usage periods change. At the end of the call, the representative said that I could re-apply. This made no sense to me because I already was approved and had the account for 12 years plus it would drop my score for unnecessarily going through the entire process again. 

I have other credit cards with other companies and I have received notifications in advance about non-use and that I would need to use the card soon to avoid account closure.

Discover has effectively wiped {$15000.00} worth of available credit which will tank my credit score for no good reason. We are in the middle of a pandemic and with the uncertainty of everything going, the last thing you want to do is close the account of a customer who was responsible with their credit and never missed a payment. 

All I am asking for is that my credit account and line be restored as it shouldn't have been closed. I also want Discover to do the responsible thing and notify customers when they are approaching their arbitrary non-use time limit which would avoid all of this in the first place.",Credit card or prepaid card,DISCOVER BANK,1

"This is a request as authorized by the FCRA 611 Procedure in case of disputed accuracy [ 15 U.S.C. 1681i ] This request is regarding the account listed below : Radius Global Solutions This account has previously been reported on my credit file and was subsequently deleted after the item was disputed and could not be verified. OnXX/XX/2020. I requested a copy of my credit report under my rights through the FACTA act. This item was not contained in my credit file on that date. On XX/XX/2020,  after being denied credit for a home student based upon negative information being reported through XXXX  and XXXX. I requested a second copy of my credit report under my rights to review my credit report after denial of credit. The account in question suddenly reappeared on the report dated XX/XX/2020. I immediately completed an online dispute for this account. In response to this dispute you sent me a letter dated XX/XX/2020 ( with confirmation number XXXX ). In this letter it stated that my investigation was completed and that you verified that this item belongs to me. I have two problems with the way reporting on this account has been handled by XXXX. First, according to my XX/XX/XXXX credit report, this item was reported in XXXX. Even giving you a very generous assumption that this item was reported to you on XX/XX/2020. I find it very difficult to believe that "" additional information regarding this item '' sufficient enough to prove this is my account could have been provided to you by XX/XX/XXXX, only one day after the account was re-reported to you. Furthermore, I find it very odd that you're letter "" verifying this account '' predates my dispute of this account.

Please furnish me with copies of any and all such certification. ( ii ) If any information that has been deleted from a consumer 's file pursuant to subparagraph ( A ) is reinserted in the file, the consumer reporting agency shall notify the consumer of the reinsertion in writing not later than 5 business days after the reinsertion or, if authorized by the consumer for that purpose, by any other means available to the agency. I received no such notification. This is a serious violation of the FCRA, and I reserve the right to pursue further action. ( iii ) Additional information. As part of, or in addition to, the notice under clause ( ii ), a consumer reporting agency shall provide to a consumer in writing not later than 5 business days after the date of the reinsertion ( I ) a statement that the disputed information has been reinserted ; ( II ) the business name and address of any furnisher of information contacted and the telephone number of such furnisher, if reasonably available, or of any furnisher of information that contacted the consumer reporting agency, in connection with the reinsertion of such information ; and ( III ) a notice that the consumer has the right to add a statement to the consumer 's file disputing the accuracy or completeness of the disputed information.

"While I was on a XXXX XXXX flight to visit my parents in XXXX, TX ( with my credit card on my person ), 3 fraudulent transactions were made at "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' with my credit card in the amounts of XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, respectively. This was on XX/XX/XXXX. I received a call later that night from my hotel room alerting me to the fraud, and when I checked my statement, sure enough, there were 3 purchases that I definitely did not make on my statement. I called USAA, my credit card issuer, and alerted them that these charges were fraudulent. Through a long process of going back and forth with the credit card company ( USAA ), the company, repeatedly denied my fraud claim and subsequent disputes. Upon providing evidence that I was not present to make the fraudulent charges, USAA stated that : "" The XXXX  determined that the Signature Visa chip card XXXX was presented in person at the time of the purchases ; therefore, authorizing the charges. In accordance with the USAA Credit Card Agreement, the primary cardholder is liable for any and all charges by joint account holders, authorized persons, or anyone allowed to use the account. Determining the identity of the person ( s ) who presented the card will not change the decision of liability. XXXX XXXX, upon receipt of your most recent submission to the CFPB, we conducted another review of the credit card transactions. We identified no activity indicative of theft or account takeover, and you have presented no new information that would warrant a change in our position. The decision to hold you liable for the credit card charges is upheld, and we respectfully deny your request to delete the charges from your account history or credit card balance. If you have additional questions regarding this matter, our staff remains available to assist you. '' Essentially, USAA said that determining that I was not the one who made the fraudulent charges will not change their decision that I am liable for them. I did not authorize anyone else to use my card and I have no joint account holders. As USAA knows, I am the only authorized user of my credit card. 

I would like to know two things : * Why is it that "" Determining the identity of the person ( s ) who presented the card will not change the decision of liability ''? If someone other than me made the charges, it is fraud. Nobody else is authorized in any way to do business in my name and I do not give out my credit card. I certify that I did not authorize anybody else to use that credit card nor did I give mine to anybody else. In fact, as the attached signed statement points out, my card was on my person in Texas while the charge was made in XXXX XXXX. 
* If neither I nor an authorized user / joint account holder of the card made a transaction, doesn't the 0 fraud liability clause mean that I should not be held liable? There is nobody else authorized to use my credit card within USAA. Does USAA claim that I, the cardholder, somehow benefitted from this? If so, I would imagine that USAA has some evidence to back this up beyond not knowing how the fraud occurred. I would like to see this evidence if it exists. Please explain in detail how this denial complies with 1026.12 ( b ) ( 1 ) -- the definition of unauthorized use, and 1026.12 ( b ) ( 2 ) -- the conditions of  liability of the Truth in Lending Act. It seems to me that USAA is legally required to resolve this fraud claim by reimbursing me for the fraud.

The last request was in XX/XX/XXXX and I have followed up with calls and emails several times in XXXX, XXXX and XXXX with no full history. 

I was recently told by Nelnet rep that the {$16000.00} may still be on my account and I would have to prove via a settlement agreement that it should have been removed. I advised that when I received the letter and called the collection agency they said they would not send a settlement or anything in writing but that once the account was current the fees would automatically be removed. 

I was told that per my loan agreement the lender is entitled to seek attorney 's fees to collect. I respond, that likely this is true but the legal fees would have to be reasonable. {$16000.00} for a signal demand letter is not reasonable. {$25.00} - {$100.00} is more reasonable.

"To Whom It May Concern : I was looking at XXXX XXXX online and wanting to buy a song. Next thing I know I am getting a monthly charge to my bank account via my bank debit/credit card going back to 2018. I disputed this first round of charges with XXXX and after several lengthy phone calls with my Chase bank and XXXX they canceled the recurring charge and credit back f the monies. So I thought the issue resolved and the recurring charge was handled. 

Then I was reviewing my bank statement this month and discovered they have restarted the recurring charge. The only reason I didn't catch the charges is that I have multiple online subscriptions the auto debit my account like XXXX ... of whom are authorized ... and who are for the exact same amount {$9.00}. However, this time I did not even go to the XXXX website nor access their music services or library. I explained this to the XXXX representative that It could be ascertained by XXXX that I had not and have not been to their website nor had I used their XXXX services at anytime!!! 

In short, at NO TIME did I ever authorize, sign-up or otherwise even visit the XXXX website. I contacted XXXX this month ( XXXX ), a second time, and the agent I spoke to said she could credit back two months services and cancel the account. I asked to speak with someone with more authority, as I wanted all the fees they charged me refunded, and the XXXX representative said that was all she could do. 

In summation, I am requesting a full refunds of all the monies charged to my bank account. In addition I want to lodge an official complaint that I believe that the way this service was added and then billed to my account was done deceptively and as a predatory practice. I think they intentionally get you to click on something to agree to them billing you each month and you have no idea you signed up for anything. Then when you find out they are billing you and you want to dispute it they make the process difficult and time consuming so that when the agree to cancel the account and only refund some or none of your monies you reluctantly agree as you have no real recourse except, Thank XXXX!, that we have the CFPB!",Checking or savings account,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,3

"In XXXX of 2019, I closed my American Express account at the beginning of my account calendar year. I was fed up with constant fees - such as the annual and rewards program fee. We were very long time cardholders. 

After cancelling the card, the customer service rep said I was still obligated to pay for next year 's reward fee even though I cancelled the card prior to it restarting for the year - even though the card was cancelled before the new Reward Program period began. The representative found it funny that American Express intentionally charges the Rewards Program fee right before the annual fee. He said the fee was the cost of canceling. 

Im sure you will respond that the credit card agreement allows the charge for the fee however, the act of fraud is when a party intentionally acts to deceive. 

Charging the annual rewards prior to renewal is a dishonest act.

"Starting with my XX/XX/XXXX statement, I wrote a check to US Bank to balance transfer {$1800.00} that was supposed to get me 0 % interest until XX/XX/XXXX. I did another check balance transfer on the same card with my XX/XX/XXXX statement for {$1800.00} that again was supposed to be 0 % interest unto XX/XX/XXXX. On my XX/XX/XXXX statement, I made a car payment to my wife 's car and it somehow counted as a cash advance in the amount of {$580.00}. The cash advance rate on this card is 25.99 %. My minimum payment on this statement was {$70.00} and I made payments that totaled {$1500.00} for this month and I was charged interest on the cash advance and on the purchases that totaled around {$23.00}. 

On my XXXX statement, I made a lot of purchases ( 16.99 % interest ), but also made a payment in the amount of {$4800.00} ( minimum payment was {$56.00} ) and was charged {$8.00} in interest on the cash advance that still somehow had a balance. 

On my XXXX statement, I made more purchases, but also paid {$1200.00} in payments with a {$120.00} minimum payment. One of my 0 % balance transfers was paid off by this month and I was charged {$66.00} in interest on my purchases ( 16.74 % interest now ) and {$.00} on the cash advance that was still not paid off, but now has a balance under {$10.00}. 

On my XXXX statement, I made more purchases and made payments of {$4500.00} ( minimum payment of {$100.00} ). This month, my other 0 % balance transfer was paid off, the cash advance still was not paid off and I was charged {$.00} in interest on the cash advance and {$67.00} in interest on purchases. 

It was with this last statement that I finally realized that they were paying off my lowest interest balances first and sticking me with the interest on my highest balances. It was my understanding that the Credit Card Act of 2009 made it the law that companies had to apply any "" overpayment '' ( anything paid above the minimum payment ) to my highest interest balances first and pay those off before moving to the next highest interest. When I called US Bank and asked them about it, they said the law changed and they were not required to do anything of the sort. They could apply my money how they see fit and have been applying my entire payment to the lowest interest balances, which is why my 0 % interest balances were paid off before the 25 % cash advance was paid off ( still not paid off technically ).

If they're right, let me know if the law changed or how I'm interpreting this wrong. But I couldn't find anything that said that info was correct and it appears they're breaking the law by doing this to me. Let me know though!

By the time I finish paying off my loan balance I will have paid almost two times the amount that I borrowed which is not 4.5 %. This is just wrong. Students are misled when it comes to the methods lenders use to collect the absolute maximum amount of interest they can while making it sound like a fair agreement where you pay just 4.5 %. 

Another complaint I have is that I defaulted on my loan thanks to the recession in XXXX where I was unable to find work. When I found employment and was able to start paying again I had to enter into a loan rehabilitation plan in order to start paying back my loan and was charged 18 % of my principle balance just to be able to start paying back my loan. This is just wrong also. 

My last complaint has to do with the school that deceived me also. I was told they were an accredited college and that my credits would transfer to the other colleges and universities. It was my plan to attend college after getting my associated degree to get my engineering degree. When I enrolled I was informed that my credits from XXXX would not transfer to the state XXXX college I was enrolling in and that I would have to take all the classes over again. Not only that, but the school I attended was shut down because of deceptive tactics and other dishonorable methods. 

I feel like I have been totally robbed. It baffles me how young adults are taken advantage of and misled by our educational and lending institutions. This is so wrong and so unfair, and it needs to be correct. If we have to mislead people in order to make huge profits then we are selling a product or a service that has no business being sold. 

When it's all said and done, I will have paid over {$80000.00} for an associates degree from a school that was shut down because they were corrupt. I am truly disappointed with this system and how the people who are keeping this country and economy running competitively are so frequently violated.

"Hello, I have incurred great hardships over the past few years from the excact same situation listed below approximately occurring 3 years ago. It was my first credit card and did not realize that the auto pay i set up with my bank wasn't working and that capital one was not receiving payment until it was very overdue. They were very cold in their reply regarding the information they reported to the credit bureaus and, despite providing evidence of my attempts to pay them on time, I did in fact, not pay them and didn't notice because of my own lack of due diligence. Because of the impact this had on my credit, I was unable to get another apartment as my lease was up the month this all transpired, and was left without a place to live. Since then, I have walked several miles to work and back every day. I have been homeless, sleeping on benches, in co-workers cars, and eventually went to renting a couch, and then a cheap room. Recently I have moved into a much nicer home with roomates that are taking me to work, but only under the agreement that I would get a vehicle as soon as possible, something that won't be able, even if capital one did remove the negative report, as the process would take months and by then I will be homeless and without a job. 

Now, because of the events listed above that happened in XXXX ' I pay close very attention to my capital one account, and are quite sure that the similar situation described below has the key difference of capital one reporting that my payment was made, and then not informing me that the payment of {$62.00} was refunded at the request of my bank, until after the account was already delinquent on the XXXX. ( The refund was processed after hours on the XXXX ). If there was any saving grace in rushing out to send them money via western union on the XXXX, it was nullified by them not posting the payment until the XXXX. I have detailed this below and would like to reiterate that the hardships I endured from the previous XXXX XXXX drop will repeat because of this. One again I find myself far from work, this time not a walk-able distance, and without a vehicle, which I am unable to replace without financing. My credit score prior to this event was XXXX, as of today it is XXXX. I live 22 miles from my current place of employment. 


My payment with capital one was due on XX/XX/2019. I set up a direct deposit ACH wire transfer from my bank, to capital one, about XXXX weeks prior to this date. Their site offered no option to start the transfer earlier, only on the due date. On the XXXX the payment was processed and I received an email from capital one saying that my payment was received. Two days later, on the XXXX I received an email that the payment had been refunded ( it was actually refunded on the XXXX, after business hours ) without any information as to why, just that I would still need to pay. 

At this point ( the XXXX ) I am now very close or 30 days late. I called capital one and my bank, they both informed me that it was refunded because paying bills through ACH transfers if not a feature of my bank account, despite having done so in the past with the same account. About XXXX hours into my call with capital one, they decided to contact my bank over a 3 way call to find out why it was no longer working, but because the average hold time for my bank, like their own, was over an hour and a half due to the COVID situation, we were unable to complete the three way call and eventually disconnected. It is now the XXXX in the afternoon ( the entire morning was spent on the phone with capital one, to no avail. The closest capital one branch is hundreds of miles away, and the agent on the phone said that they could no longer accept payments with a debit card, despite having paid them with one in the past. Distraught, I contemplated the effects this would have on my life, again, after struggling for years to raise my score back to the good range it was in before opening an account with them, became extremely distraught until I recalled an option to pay with XXXX XXXX ( one the agent did not mention at all when I was panicking about how to pay them, and rushed out to send a money order, and paid an extra XXXX XXXX  to have it transferred immediately. Despite the funds being made immediately available to them after sending XXXX XXXX, ( i verified this with XXXX XXXX and they explained how guaranteed funds work XXXX Capital one did not report the payment as being received until Monday the XXXX, thus making me over 30 days late. This was reflected on my report, which fluctuates between XXXX and XXXX depending on what I currently owe capital one to a XXXX, specifically because of this incident, as I have no other accounts on my credit report whatsoever, and my score relies solely on my status with capital one. 

There is no way to successfully dispute this through the normal process of writing to capital one and having them review it. One of the many agents I spoke to on the phone informed me that it would likely withstand being reported late, as they did not process it until the XXXX, despite all of the events described above that made it virtually impossible to pay them on time Capital One 's actions in refunding the payment on my due date, but after their business hours, not informing me of the event until wo days later when it was already unagruably late, not processing the payment I made on the XXXX until two days after it was made available to them and, refusing my pleas to re-evaluate the situation before they reported it ( i called in a begged for this on the XXXX after was informed of the refund, on the XXXX, a day after i sent the XXXX XXXX payment and on the XXXX when the payment finally posted ) Their misinformation regarding the status of my payment and unwillingness to help me before it was reported, has left me in a situation where I will become homeless again, without a vehicle I will not make it to my job, and I will once again be in a situation where I am in dire straits, despite going to work everyday and taking what should have been all the actions needed to better my score and improve my situation.",Credit card or prepaid card,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,1

"XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, My wallet was lost/stolen, while I was visiting XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. There were 3 cards in that wallet and no ID cards : 2 Visa cards from XXXX XXXX XXXX, and 1 MasterCard from Barclays US. There were unauthorized charges on all 3 of the cards. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received the attached letter from Barclays. 

The charges in dispute are the following : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$1500.00} XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$5700.00} Barclays is refusing to accept my fraud claim due to the following reasons, stated in their response : This decision was made in part ; due to your confirmation that the credit card was in your possession within minutes of the fraud occurring as a parking charge was validated by you. Our investigation confirmed a pattern expensive purchases being made at high end retailers and then being claimed as fraud. 

It can be easily verified that the parking charge that is being referred to was made using XXXX XXXX, i.e., it was an online transaction. This, in no shape or form, confirms that the card was in my possession, within minutes of the occurrence of the fraud, as they have stated. Furthermore, the investigator seems to have not paid any attention to the fact that a police report was filed : XXXX Police Report XXXX XXXX/Officer XXXX/Badge # XXXX Under penalty of perjury, this confirms that these charges have NOT been made by me and filing the report and the investigation by the police surely confirms it. 

With the statement Our investigation confirmed a pattern expensive purchases being made at high-end retailers and then being claimed as fraud, are you accusing me of fraud? Are you aware of the implications that could have for you in court if and when I sue, when this is proven to be bogus? False accusations could have serious repercussions. With any fraud/transaction dispute claim, especially, when the claim has been approved by the bank, it is my understanding that a full and through investigation has been done, confirming that the charges were indeed fraudulent. Each claim has to also be looked at independently from any other previous claim. Looking at the history of my transactions, it can easily be verified that I have never made any purchases that I have deemed as authorized at a XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX. Claims as such, should all have been easily addressed with my filing of a police report for this claim. 

I have no complaints regarding the closure of my account. It is Barclays right to close this account due to business justifications. However, there was $ 200+ in rewards value that has been taken away due to this closure, that could have been applied as statement credit to the fraudulent account balance that you are refusing to reimburse me for. 

I seriously advise the Barclays Bank to respect the law and reimburse me for the unauthorized transactions made with my card. The reporting of the fraud was prompt, a police report has been filed, and I had never done business with any of these merchants. The parking ticket transaction was made using XXXX XXXX, and not in the form of card-present transaction with CHIP. 

If Barclays Bank still refuses to reimburse me for these charges, with the explanation/new information that I am providing in this Letter, I would make it my goal to talk to as many journalists/reporters that are willing to write about my story regarding the banks wrong-doing, creating a PR XXXX for Barclays, as well as suing the bank in court for the fraudulent charges, plus my attorney fees, plus defamation and wrongly accusing me of fraud. 
I really do hope that we could solve this matter amicably. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, -XXXX XXXX",Credit card or prepaid card,BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE,1
"FACTS On XX/XX/2019 I contacted the HSBC fraud department to communicate issues with suspicious and unrecognized activity on my card. The fraud department indicated that they could cancel the card and issue a new card in six business days. I emphasized the importance of receiving this replacement card in a timely manner. I was reassured that a replacement card would be issued in six business days. Unfortunately, HSBC failed to deliver the replacement card in a timely manner. This letter documents my bad experience with your customer service team when I called on Tuesday XX/XX/2019. 

CONCERNS IS CUSTOMER GOODWILL WORTH XXXX DOLLARS? 
The HSBC customer service representative in the XXXX did not show any empathy when I explained my frustration with not having the HSBC Mastercard. I rely on the credit card to make timely payments to different vendors. Not having the credit card caused me significant inconveniences where timely payment was not possible. The customer service representative conceded that the company failed to provide a replacement card in a timely manner. However, the customer service representative explained that there was no way to expedite the process. 

Merely saying that you are sorry seems like a platitude where is no corresponding action to compensate the other party for the hardship. After considerable debate, the customer service representative offered me XXXX bonus points for my troubles. The representative was extremely reluctant to admit that XXXX bonus points was only {$5.00}. Essentially, HSBC did not appreciate any of the difficulties that I had endured as a result on not having access to a credit card. The company seems to indicate that my time is only worth XXXX dollars. Despite asking the question several times, the XXXX representative could not name a single item that I could actually buy with my XXXX dollar credit. 

It seems insincere to apologize for the delay in providing a replacement credit card with XXXX bonus points. Even worse, your customer service representatives acted in a manipulative way to imply that XXXX bonus points was a significant concession. I am guessing that a XXXX dollar credit is not a significant investment in customer goodwill by a large multinational financial institution. 

CONCERNS RUDE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES I spoke with three different representatives over a two hour period on Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX. In the course of these conversations, I incurred the following unprofessional behavior : 1 ) IGNORE THE QUESTION The customer service representatives would merely ignore difficult questions and simply read from a script. I do not like being treated like a child or an XXXX who can be ignored. I expect to be treated with respect. I am not an Alzheimers patient who will forget that no one answered my question. 

2 ) PLACING ME ON MUTE AND IGNORING ME I was intentionally placed on mute and a customer service supervisor did not even listen to my concerns. She denied this unprofessional behavior. However, she could not repeat any aspect of my concerns when I asked her to prove that she was listening. 

3 ) EXTENDED HOLD TIME After speaking to two customer service representatives, I was placed on hold for over 30 minutes before a manager eventually answered the line. No one ever provided an update during the 30 minutes on hold. No one ever apologized or attempted to clarify the unreasonable wait time. It seems like HSBC merely wants to frustrate customers with bad customer service so they eventually hang up. 

4 ) LIES I was promised that someone from HSBC would contact me the following day. Unfortunately, no one from your company contacted me on Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX. 

5 ) HANG UP My attempt to resolve this issue with HSBC was eventually terminated when a customer service representative hung up on me. Good customer service involves a certain level of patience and understanding. Unfortunately, customer service representatives who are easily frustrated and lose their patience is not acceptable.",Credit card or prepaid card,HSBC NORTH AMERICA HOLDINGS INC.,1

He had left a voice message telling me to call him regarding a specific claim number. I told him that I can not receive these types of calls at work and asked what he was calling about. He said it was regarding a loan that was taken out in my name last year. He then said that I needed to pay {$3000.00} to get the claim cleared. I told him I didnt have that kind of money and asked him to send me something in writing about this. I have not received any written communication about this. Mr. XXXX refused to send me anything in writing and said that he could email me something. He threatened to call the payroll dept. at my job and take 20 % of my income until the amount is settled and seemed to be rushing to do this.

Right in the middle of my sentence, he accused me of a stall tactic and abruptly hung up on me. That was very rude and unprofessional. Totally uncalled for as I had not raised my voice, called him any names or acted rudely in any way. If anybody was trying a stall tactic, it was him.

"Santander closed an old bank account and opened a new account for me following a fraud incident. The Santander representative who opened the account made a banking error that resulted in multiple online accounts that denied me the ability to set up bill pay with my new account. The Santander Fraud department moved my money from my old account to the new account and allowed a blocked account to be billed. Recently, I learned that old bills are getting paid in my name for amounts set up in my old bank account. When Santander finally gave me access to my online account ( 2 years later ), it turns out that no bills are coming out of my new account but, bills are still being sent in my name somehow. I did not set up the bills from my new account and Santander claims it is unable to stop the bills because it has to be done through me accessing the online account. However, I have no access to the old online account ( which was supposedly blocked by Santander ). When I attempted to call the third party that is paying the bills set up by Santander, I was placed on hold for two hours and then the third party ( Santander 's Bill Pay service ) let me know that they can not access anything without a bank representative, however, the bank representatives did not wait to continue the call. 
Regarding the blocked bank account : Santander claims that a blocked account was billed because there was insufficient money in the account. Santander claims that they offered to switch the automatic transactions but I declined their offer. Santander did not offer to switch the transactions. Their former XXXX, MA branch advised that I not allow anyone to reach into my account and that I set up bill pay transactions. Santander 's Fraud department moved my money out of the blocked account to the new account and let me know they would monitor transactions ( and they did not do that ). Subsequent to the money being moved, Santander 's Fraud department allowed the  blocked account to be billed, then sent a claim to XXXX  that my account was closed with a - {$2000.00} balance. At the time this happened, there was more than enough money in my new account to cover this amount. While communicating with their corporate center trying to get details of the transactions they said totaled {$2000.00} ( that was not clear from the statements they sent ) I found out, when attempting to open an account for my children at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, that Santander had sent out this negative report to XXXX  XXXX. At the time their corporate center had assured me that they did not send out the report and wanted to work with me. 
Santander then expects me to take the time to fill in a fraud complaint kit to send the same complaint I spent hours with their branch, Fraud department, IT department and corporate center on. Their error has cost me time and money and now they are claiming they closed the matter because I did not take the time to fill out the kit ( and send it to the Fraud department that caused the issue to begin with ). 
I continue to have a third party unknown to me paying bills in my name with no online access to my account. 
Why did Santander not take my information and fill out their kit at the time.

Why is Santander claiming that a {$400.00} international wire was flagged by an intermediary bank and have not been able to provide me with a letter from this intermediary bank.

"There are three issues that resulted in customer confusion and ultimately the misapplication of fees and interest to my Bank of America credit card account after I had set up an automatic monthly payment starting in XXXX. 

Issue 1 : The Automatic Payment, set to process on the "" due date '', would not process until 1-5 business days after the scheduled due date. For example, in XXXX, my bill was due on XX/XX/XXXX. The autopay was set to process on the "" due date '' in Bank of America 's system, but it did not process until XX/XX/XXXX. See attached. 

Issue 2 : The Automatic Payment, set to process the "" Amount Due '', did not process the monthly statement balance, rather the minimum amount due plus any fees/interest. This is highly confusion because Bank of America offers 4 payment options for the Automatic Payments : Minimum Amount Due, Amount Due, Account Balance, Fixed Monthly Rate. None of these accurately describe paying the monthly statement balance ( what Bank of America apparently calls Account Balance ), but Account Balance is a misnomer in of itself. 

The result of these two issues in the Automatic Payment system is that not only do customers autopay their bills later than the due date and incur late fees, but that interest is assessed on the remaining statement balance due because the AutoPay only pays the "" Amount Due '' - or in Bank of America 's terms, just the minimum due plus fees/interest. This is not only confusing, but potentially exploitative if intentional - especially on an AutoPay system that is designed to make payments easier and less of a hassle. 

Lastly, it is worth noting that the customer support specialist and the credit card account specialist noted that this is a source of confusion for multiple customers. The credit card account specialist even indicated that she had put in a note about the issues for prior customers multiple times. As an informed customer already with multiple credit card accounts on automatic payments across multiple banks, this should not have been an issue - but I doubt I'm the only one who has had this issue.

AT NO TIME DID I PROVIDE MY AMEX account number for this. I was simply asked if I had an American Express account and I was notified of a {$2000.00} payment into my Amex account, and I was able to see to the funds go from pending to clear prior to making the purchases requested of me. I have no knowledge of how that payment was made or by whom. I assume that is where the fraud was initiated. 
The payment made to my account seemed legitimate and that is the reason that I moved forward with the shopping experience. 
I became suspicious when the item I was asked to mail XXXX   was not able to be delivered to the address that was provided. 
THAT IS WHEN I CALLED AMEX, and told them I was concerned that my card had been compromised. 
Most of the correspondence initially took place through email, and then moved on to text messaging, I have included ALL of this documentation as well as the police report. 

I realize there is not any type of recourse or chargeback to either the XXXX XXXX or the Mail Center. I want American Express to be fully aware that this entire transaction from the {$2000.00} payment to my account resulting in me purchasing an i-phone and mailing it XXXX to XXXX. Because this is fraud, for both American Express and me as the victim, I am asking that American Express not hold me liable for any this. 

I am and have been an excellent long time customer of Amex. I want this resolved immediately, it is causing me tremendous undue stress. 
This puts me in a situation of Financial Elder Abuse, I am an innocent victim who was taken advantage of. American Express should have called me about the $ XXXX clearly they could see it was not from my bank account.

"This is the letter we presented to Chase. 


XX/XX/XXXX On Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX a text was received from Chase Fraud Services that a transaction in the amount of {$9600.00} was attempted and declined on our credit card ending in XXXX for an XXXX gift card. I called Chase and found out that not one, but three transactions were declined by Chase for XXXX gift cards, the subsequent two attempts were in the amounts of {$8600.00} and {$9100.00}. 

I confirmed with Chase that those XXXX gift cards were definitely not authorized purchase by either my husband or myself. The account was closed, and new credit cards were issued with a new account number. 

We received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX from Chase regarding more information about our fraud claim. The first line of the letter states, Thank you for letting us know about the unauthorized use of your account above. The last line of the letter instructs us to call if there is any additional unauthorized activity. To our knowledge, no further unauthorized purchases were attempted. 

Yesterday, Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX a message from Chase regarding this claim. My husband and I went to the XXXX Chase branch and together with XXXX XXXX, a Relationship Banker, we called Chase Fraud department and eventually ended up with XXXX, a member of the Chase Fraud Recovery team, the woman who left me a message regarding our closed account ending in XXXX. She indicated to us that the charges for {$9600.00}, {$8600.00} and {$9100.00} were being reinstated because they received a phone call from my husband on XX/XX/XXXX and email from me, same day authorizing the transactions. We emphatically denied once again that we did not authorize any charges, verbally or in writing. 

XXXX, Chase Fraud Recovery told us to continue investigating the claim she would need the order number for these transactions. XXXX our Relationship Banker at the local branch, reiterated that wasnt possible since we never initiated the purchase transaction for these XXXX gift cards so we have no paper trail to give any reference numbers to continue the denial of the fraud claim. XXXX also questioned why if we indeed did authorize said purchases on XX/XX/XXXX, we are just now being told the charges are legitimate and therefore being reinstated for payment. XXXX, Chase Fraud Recovery said they would further investigate our claims and yet {$27000.00} was placed on our credit for these fraudulent XXXX purchase. 

Chase has done nothing to protect our identity and has processed these transactions against our authorization to do so. We asked the Chase Fraud Recovery representative to provide us with the telephone number that the call purported to be from my husband authorizing purchase was made from, she would only say the number was the number on our profile. We asked her for the email address for the email authorization of said purchase and she said she couldnt tell us ; she only could tell us the domain name was XXXX. We asked for the IP address, she couldnt tell us that. My emails from that time period indicate no email correspondence from me to Chase. 

On Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX, my husband received an email from XXXX indicating a package was scheduled for delivery that day from XXXX. My husband did not place an order with XXXX. He didnt even know who XXXX was. 

We were expecting company that morning. When they arrived, we went outside to greet them. They had parked in our driveway which is located on XXXX XXXX. A XXXX truck pulled up to the corner of XXXX and XXXX. No one got out of the track and approached our front door, so we thought a delivery was being made elsewhere. XXXX truck drives away and we continue with our guest and then decide to go out to lunch. 
My husband receives another email from XXXX confirming delivery and stating package was left at the door. This was not true. We were home, we had not left for lunch, when the delivery was supposedly made, and the package left at our front door. We have six security cameras with exterior views of our home and street that are on a continuous loop. My husband reviews the camera and sees at the time of the delivery a man got out of a blue or XXXX XXXX SUV, approached the XXXX truck, walks back to his vehicle with a box in hand and speeds away. 

He called XXXX and they said the man identified himself as XXXX XXXX. They said their drivers are not supposed to give packages to anyone walking up to their vehicles. A claim was filed. The claim number is XXXX. Per the instructions received from XXXX to XXXX, no signature was required. 

We have no idea what was in the box from XXXX. We didnt follow up with XXXX because nothing was charged to any of our credit cards or banking accounts. 
We dont know if these two events are related however, after the phone call with Chase yesterday, we did some research and XXXX sells XXXX gift cards. We this this coincidence is suspicious. And again, if these two incidents are related, Chase approved these transactions after our denials that we authorized these purchases. 
Chase it seems is doing nothing to protect us from this fraud and is trying to hold us accountable. 

End of letter Additional details : 1. Chase Fraud Team is claiming that I, XXXX XXXX, gave verbal authorization to approve the 3 financial transactions from our land line on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  EST. This is not true. Chase is refusing to allow to me to hear my actual voice recording approving the transactions. 

2. After reviewing our telephone record call logs, we made NO outbound calls on XX/XX/XXXX. 

3. At XXXX XXXX EST my wife receives text message indicating transaction was declined for {$9600.00} and requesting verification if transaction was actually our transaction. 

4..On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX EST my wife, XXXX XXXX responds to the text message declining purchases. Chase fraud did not say that transactions were given prior approval by me earlier that morning. They continued to proceed with cancellation of credit card and issuance of new cards.

"My mother has an account with Chase Bank that I am a joint signer on. My mother passed away on XX/XX/2020. She receives multiple ACH credits to her account to include Social Security, XXXX payments, XXXX XXXX pay and VA benefits. Because she died on the last day of XXXX, I knew that all benefits credited to her account in XX/XX/2020 would need to be returned. I left all funds in her account, awaiting reclamation requests for all funds from the four agencies. XXXX  reclaimed their funds on XX/XX/2020. A hold was placed on the account for most of the remaining balance on the account. Chase received a reclamation from Social Security that was dated XX/XX/2020. On XX/XX/2020 they debited {$1700.00}, the amount of the Social Security reclamation and sent me a copy of the reclamation and letter stating they had returned the funds. On XX/XX/2020 Chase again debited {$1700.00}. I thought this was a mistake and called the Chase Customer Service line to speak with someone about this. Considering the current situation with COVID-19, my local branch is not open so I was not able to visit my branch to sort this out. I was advised that the general Customer Service Center could not assist me with this particular request and was transferred to a different department. I believe this was a department specifically for electronic transaction issues. After speaking with someone and explaining the situation I was again told that this department could not help me either and was asked to call the general Customer Service Center line again. I stated to her that I did not want to be transferred back to them because they had already advised me that they could not assist me with this matter. She gave me two other phone numbers to try to see if I could reach a better department to address my issue. At one point I asked to speak to a supervisor at the call center and was told that no supervisor was available but that they could take my name and number and have a supervisor call me back within XXXX days. After speaking with a total of three different departments and spending no less than three hours trying to reach someone who could assist me, I finally made an online appointment with my local bank to have a representative from my branch call me to try and resolve this. I scheduled an appointment for XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. I never received a phone call on XX/XX/XXXX. I scheduled another phone appointment for XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX and a representative did call me at the appointed time. I explained my situation and he stated he was not able to help me with this but that his manager might be able to. I was transferred to his manager and again explained what had happened. She stated that a mistake had not been made and that the funds they sent back to Social Security was for the XXXX payment and the XXXX payment. I advised her that this is not correct. Because my mother was alive the entire month of XXXX, the social security payment she received on XX/XX/XXXX she was entitled to because the XXXX payment was for the month of XXXX. The XXXX payment was for the month of XXXX. She died on the last day of XXXX so I knew the social security payment made on XX/XX/XXXX would be returned. She again stated that this is not correct and that she would not be able to help me. I tried to explain it to her again and she again stated that Chase had not made an error and that she could not help me.The only Social Security reclamation Chase received was for the XX/XX/XXXX payment, not the XXXX payment as well. As a last resort I called the phone number that is listed on the letter Chase sent me along with the copy of the reclamation. I have attempted to reach someone at this phone number multiple times and every time I call I get a recorded message that states the "" debit card department is closed ''. When the XXXX and VA benefits are returned, this will leave my mother 's account overdrawn over {$1600.00}, because they have returned the social security benefits twice. The resulting balance of my mother 's account should be approximately {$60.00} once all funds are returned. I am unable to speak with anyone at Chase that can help me with this after multiple attempts over the course of multiple days. I feel I have no choice but to file a complaint.

"On XX/XX/20 while checking my bank account, I noticed a charge that I did not authorize. There had been the same charges attempted twice in XXXX, but Wells Fargo blocked the attempted charges and alerted me and there was no adverse action against my account. However, on this occasion Wells Fargo honored the charge which left my account with a negative balance for the amount that was honored by Wells Fargo. I filed a dispute with Wells Fargo for the transaction in question. But there were other charges for bills that I authorized that were processed before the fraudulent transaction. I have a linked savings and checking account with Wells Fargo. Although I was reluctant to deposit any funds into my checking account, due to the outstanding fraudulent charge, I deposited an amount that would cover the 2 charges that I did authorize to cover those transactions. Additionally, I deposited a large amount into my savings account expecting that Wells Fargo would reverse the fraudulent charge by the end of the business day. Wells Fargo 's policy regarding linked accounts is that they will cover charges from checking account overages with funds in a linked existing savings account. However, there was no need to enact this policy for my account because around XXXX XXXX on the same date ( XX/XX/20 ) I transferred a large amount from my savings account into my checking account even though the fraudulent charge still appeared, and the issue was not resolved. I did this because I was expecting other bills that I had paid to be presented for processing. On XX/XX/20, my account was charged 2 separate fees of {$35.00} each, totaling {$70.00}.

"In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a loan modification for the mortgage on my home that I have lived in for 22 years. It was a principal and interest only loan, with my monthly payment totaling {$440.00}. The loan was made possible by extending the years on my previous mortgage, which thereby lowered my payments. The interest rate was fixed for a 30-year term. In order to be accepted for this modification, I had to go through a 3 month trial period to ensure full payments of {$440.00} were made by the first of each month. I met this requirement and therefore, my mortgage payment stayed at the rate of {$440.00} for the remainder ofthe loan.

This is the 2nd time in the past 6 months they did this to me. They also stole XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX when they took money out of my account but did not send the check to XXXX XXXX. They said they refuse to notify customers when they have an error/trouble processing a check, and they refuse to balance their books, so any time they fail to mail a check to a recipient, they just keep the money and never tell the sender ( me ) that they didn't write the check or it wasn't cashed or whatever. Employee XXXX told me it was my job to call TCF during hours when it was convenient to TCF ; if it's not convenient for the employee, the employee just washes his/her hands and does nothing about the theft of my funds. I won't beg them to write the check I paid them to write. I won't waste my time begging them not to steal from me. I will let them pay {$400.00} per hour to an attorney to answer this complaint from the government.

"Security over online banking is important. It is even more important when it blocks the true account holder from using the account. SunTrust bank, now Truist Bank, suspended my online checking account on XXXX. I was having trouble making XXXX bank transfers. SunTrust sent me an email to contact them by telephone. 

After spending most of the day speaking to 6 or 7 Sun Trust representatives through their telephone tree, hearing that I did not have to continue in the tree if my account was blocked, speaking to a different representative every time, repeating the same issues to different representatives, being cutoff several times while a SunTrust representative attempted to verify my telephone landline phone number through a voice authentication system my account was suspended. 

I could not access my account. The last recommended solution was to remove robo call blocking from my telephone or to visit a SunTrust branch. There are no SunTrust branches in New Jersey. 

SunTrust has no email contact number on its online banking website. It lists no employee by name or physical mailing address for contact. The system appears to be designed for telephone communication only and to eliminate the documentation of poor decisions. 

The next day, XXXX I received an email that my account had been reactivated. There was no reason given. There was no documented reason given for the account suspension. I had to trust that Sun Trust acted properly. Now with access to my account and increased motivation I could access the details in my account profile. I saw that the date of my last password change was in XX/XX/XXXXand that old telephone numbers had not been deleted. Possibly there were other errors in SunTrust information for me, but I do not have access to this. 

Based upon this experience my questions for financial regulators are the following : 1. What special controls do financial regulators have over online banking? 
2. What state regulations apply to online banks that are not licensed in the state? 
3. What reasons are justified for suspending an account? 
4. How can a customer contact a bank if no contact address is provided by the bank?",Checking or savings account,TRUIST FINANCIAL CORPORATION,3

I told the representative that I had been laid off due to Covid-19 and she became rude and told me I was "" going to court '' and hung up on me. I do not feel their behavior was appropriate and threatening me and refusing to assist me or allow me to get assistance from the original creditor is against my rights. This has caused me great emotional stress. This has been a terrible experience and they should be ashamed of themselves for denying me my rights and threatening and hanging up on me. Further more, when pressed the agent was unable to give me a valid phone number ( the hospital has my current number ) and would also not verify the address they had on file for me.

XXXX XXXX was acquired last year by a company out of XXXX XXXX called XXXX XXXX. 

It has come to my attention that XXXX XXXX  is indeed pulling half payments routinely out of my account on the XXXX and XXXX of each month, however they are only remitting a full payment to USBank once each month, not twice as I was promised.

I said somewhere I was borrowing my moms car and he said I should ask my parents for money to pay the loan. I said, well, my dad is dead. My mom is on a fixed income.

At this point Wells Fargo has stolen {$70.00} from me. XXXX XXXX indeed verified the total amount of {$190.00} was returned to Wells Fargo.

This process may take up to 120 days. If you ( sic ) efforts are successful, any money recovered will be credit to your account.

Fifth Third approved the trial for the modification and I was told that if I made three payments in a row on time, the new amount would be my mortgage payment amount moving forward and that would be the end of the trial period. 

I proceded to make the payments on time ( see attached statements from my bank ) and I am currently up to date on my modification payments. However, after I made the third trial payment, I was told that the modification could not be finalized because a third party, not previously mentioned, needed a subordination agreement fom XXXX XXXX  which holds my HELOC. I told them to call XXXX XXXX. The Representative I spoke with at the time said they could not do that to protect my privacy. They told me I needed to call XXXX  and get the subordination agreement. I called XXXX XXXX  and they told me to just have Fifth Third call them. They said that was standard practice and it happens all the time. I called Fifth Third and they reiterated that they could not and would not call XXXX XXXX. They told em to get a list from XXXX XXXX  of the requirements for a subordination agreement. I called XXXX  and asked them to send me a list of their requirements for subordination agreement for modification. I forwarded what they sent to me to Fifth Third and it turned ou not to be the correct list. The list XXXX  sent me was for a Refinance. 

At the end of XXXX, I spoke with Fifth Third hoping there had been some progress amongst the banks. Understanding there had been no progress, I arranged a conference call between the two banks and whn i finally got them both on the phone, the representative from XXXX XXXX  dropped out of the call.

I called Bank of America immediately to report this and they told me they were opening a claim to investigate. In the meantime, they posted a credit to my account in the amount stolen. 

In XXXX I received a letter from Bank of America saying my claim was denied and that the funds would be removed from my account. I called them immediately saying this was unacceptable as I was the victim of a crime, and the person I spoke with said they would re-open the claim to investigate further. To my surprise, the funds were still removed from my account on XX/XX/XXXX. This wiped the little I had in my accounts, leaving me with a balance of - {$930.00} in Checking and {$0.00} in Savings. My next pay day would not follow for 8 days, so I called Bank of America immediately that day and spoke with several people for over an hour. They said they were still looking into the claim but would not be able to post a credit to my account as it had been rejected the first time.

No one seem to want to assist to get it straighten out. No one is tries to call XXXX on my behalf to get any additional information and I am completely feed up because this loan was not authorized to be opened.

I still have an outstanding loan with them with a past due payment of {$160.00} because the first payment was due on XX/XX/2020. When I can in to purchase my car my credit score was XXXX and now my credit score is XXXX. I am tired of them giving me the run around.

On XX/XX/XXXX CHASE BANK sent me a letter to inform that the merchant has provided information in order to make the charge valid. Immediately I observed that the restaurant presented afalse receipt and they falsified my signature. So I decided to continue with the billing dispute.

I sent a response letter to the CHASE BANK on XX/XX/XXXX to inform that I did not sign any bill becausethe credit card terminal was not working as I told the representative of CHASE BANK by phone call on XX/XX/XXXX. ( Attached you will find a copy ) On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX CHASE BANK send me an e-mail to notify that the disputed charge was valid and to inform that the investigation was closed. So I am very surprised about this decision and I called CHASE BANK at XXXX XXXX  to know more details about the investigation and to explain me the bases of this decision. The representative told me that the disputed was close and I would need to call to the Fraud Unit becase that issue it was not a disputed. 

I fell that CHASE BANK should do a more detail investigation to make a decision about this Fraud. I did not approved {$5400.00} dollars with my credit card and I have never signed any receipt. The merchant falsified my signature in order to claim a valid charge on my behalf and sadly CHASE BANK validated this charges. I sent an e-mail to CHASE BANK with my letter of response as well a copy of my passport with my legal signature to compare with the falsify signature that the merchant presented. In addition I sent a copy of photos that my girlfriend and I have taken when we have dinner in that restaurant.

"There are {$720.00} in illegal fees which have been carried on my mortgage loan for a very long time which are not authorized and appear to be illegal having been added as the result of a bankruptcy where the servicer did not obtain permission of the bankruptcy court to add these fees to the account, as such these fees were added in violation of 11 USC 362, and in violation of my discharge in bankruptcy. 

Additionally, during several phone calls during the middle of XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Shellpoint customer service via telephone to request a copy of my XXXX XXXX form. I was assured that it would be provided within 7 business days and that once it had been attached to my account it would be available online. Having not received the XXXX within 7 days, I called back into customer service and was assured that the request was in process and to give it a few more days. It has now been more than 3 months and I still do not have the XXXX XXXX form and it is not available under the statement options in my online account. 

In an effort to resolve this issue, on XX/XX/XXXX I sent a Qualified Written Request ( "" QWR '' ) to Shellpoint ( see attached ). Shellpoint was required by RESPA and the Dodd Frank Act to confirm receipt of this letter within five business days and respond with an answer within 30 business days. To date Shellpoint has not confirmed receipt of my QWR nor have they provided an answer or any communication whatsoever. It has now been more than 2 months since Shellpoint received my QWR. 

As a result of Shellpoint 's refusal to remove the illegal fees, I contacted my attorney to ask for his assistance. On XX/XX/XXXX my attorney sent a letter to Shellpoint and attached a copy of my QWR to his letter ( see attached ). It has been more than two months since my QWR and my attorneys letter were sent to Shellpoint and to date Shellpoint has not responded to my attorneys XX/XX/XXXX letter or my XX/XX/XXXX QWR. 

On XX/XX/XXXX my attorney sent a follow-up letter ( see attached ) to Shellpoint CEO XXXX XXXX at two separate addresses to advise him of Shellpoint 's failure to respond to my XX/XX/XXXX QWR and his XX/XX/XXXX letter. In his letter my attorney reiterated our continued request for the following : 1. Respond to our clients QWR 2. Remove the illegally added fees from our clients account 3. Provide our client with his XXXX IRS Form XXXX Shellpoint had obligations under RESPA Section 6. As a result of Shellpoint 's blatant and flagrant refusal to respond to my XX/XX/XXXX QWR and my attorney 's letters, Shellpoint is now liable for actual damages statutory damages and putative damages under 12 U.S.C. 2605 ( e ), 12 U.S.C. 2605 ( k ) and Regulation Z.

I am asking that the CFPB intercede and investigate Shellpoint 's behavior on my specific loan as well as Shellpoint 's apparent policy of ignoring borrower 's communications as a whole. 

Indeed, I am sure that many borrowers simply get so frustrated by Shellpoint 's egregious tactics that they just give up and as such are victimized by Shellpoint through the charging of excessive illegal fees, incorrect billing, improper bookeeeping and accounting, Shellpoint 's refusal to provide documents that they are required to provide by law and Shellpoint 's flagrant disrespect for RESPA, XXXX XXXX and Regulation Z.",Mortgage,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",2

She was unable to explain within good reason why I should be home to sign for these documents, only that if I refused that legal action would be started against me. 

I asked for the number to her company.

He was able to try to convince me the debt exists by stating my social security number correctly, my maiden name, my company name, and my mother 's address which I used to reside at.I asked why they never attempted to settle this debt with me for pennies on the dollar before it came to this "" judgement day '' and he says to me "" ok, I will settle with you for {$300.00} '' His advise to me was to allow him to "" email me a DocuSign with a payment agreement, filling out my credit card information for their merchant service '' If I should choose not to do the DocuSign then he was going to pass it off to his lawyer to allow them to start the legal proceedings. I got angry at this point because I am a businesswoman and I realize just how taboo all of this talk is. So I cursed at him, and he says "" You do not need to talk to me like that .... '' & he passes me off to another woman within the company. 

As she answered the phone, I asked why I was transferred, and this woman claimed to be the department which holds the installment arrangement process. I told her I didn't wish to pay this way, why don't they use quickbooks invoicing or any other secure method where I had the opportunity to type in my personal information myself, and she assured me that it was a secure way to pay. She said "" the form you will fill out will only agree to take the correct amount of money listed, not a XXXX more. '' I suggested to her that I want to see something in writing 1st showing that the debt really exists. She and the gentleman BOTH told me that XXXX XXXX XXXX would NOT have record of the debt because it had went to collection because of not being paid for so long. This sounded pretty convincing but still, I know when a company is after their money, they will make several attempts to collect, then send to collections, and I would still receive multiple attempts from them at that point in order to collect that debt in question. I never received anything of the sorts. 

I also suggested calling her back because I wanted to investigate the subject myself.She told me that would be fine but to call back at the end of the day or they would start the legal proceedings as if I was in contempt to pay ...

"THIS IS MY FINAL DISPUTE WITH BANK OF AMERICA. I'm putting in a request that the Federal Government ( FBI ) will do an investigation on the Fraud department and all other departments in Bank of America. This bank continues to go in circles with their responses sending me a packet that still has not answered any of my questions in the original compliant ( see below ). I never asked for a refund nor would I ever want to do business with this bank again. Why did the bank allow a customer of theirs keep the XXXX  funds after I filed a police report stating it was a fraudulent transaction? Also this bank continues to cover up for employees that are fraudulently allowing things like this happen. 

My personal bank information was stolen from me. I never gave anyone permission as the bank stated in their letter. Once again the bank does not want to accept fault and continues to blame the customer. The problem is Bank of America was lazy in doing their investigation. I would call to check on my claim and none of the Customer Service Representatives had their information together. The bank never tried to even refund either of the accounts after XXXX XXXX was said to have an account as well with Bank of America. 

Its not right for the government to allow banks to keep employees that commit fraud and then the bank covers everything up. The police were involved but they can not do an investigation on all the banks in going and outgoing transactions through all the departments. This would include getting information on all the employees. Especially, the ones that have access to any transactions that include monies. 

Bank of America had the opportunity to retrieve my monies as I was told that it may have been an inside job whereas XXXX XXXX was an account holder as well of this bank. Supposedly, XXXX XXXX is close friend of hers. XXXX XXXX had the ability to call on my accounts, check the balance and find ways to withdraw the money. In the police report you will see listed to whom the money was transferred or withdrawn without my authorization. XXXX XXXX was also said to have members of the bank that she was close friends with that could monitor other Bank of America account holders. If Bank of America would check her account history I am sure they would see lump sums of monies being transferred to her account and maybe some withdrawals of that same amount. XXXX XXXX withdrew XXXX and XXXX through XXXX transfer. XXXX XXXX withdrew XXXX through XXXX transfer. I did not authorize any of these transfers on my checking or savings account. I would like say as well do to the nature of this incident and the poor communication with Bank of America. I had to replace my XXXX and XXXX cell phones as well as change my phone numbers. I did not want to risk them being spammed or hacked per directions of the wireless provider. I filed a police report in hopes that Bank of America would do their diligence to retrieve all the monies back that were unauthorized. The employees at Bank of America were lazy did not do everything they could to get any of the money back. This bank and other banks I will not list their names continue to have a bad history of employing people that will locate account holders of their bank to commit fraud. XXXX XXXX XXXX is reporting erroneous information suspected fraud activity this was actual fraud, unauthorized transactions on my checking and savings account with Bank of America. This also included two balances XXXX and XXXX. This will be the banks loss due to their own negligence for not being consistent with the investigation. At the time I reported it to the bank they had plenty of time to get all the money back. XXXX XXXX is also reporting erroneous information transacting or attempting to transact with an account in an unauthorized or prohibited manner. Both of these companies have no supporting documentation to submit erroneous claims against me. My credit worthiness and credit report is beyond great! Until this incident occurred last fall of 2018. Ive been doing my own investigation as well other legal individuals in hopes to protect other account holders that currently bank with Bank of America. This is a very serious matter especially when a bank does not admit fault but only continues to put all the blame on the account holder just so they want have to take a loss and their criminal employees can remain working their to steal innocent people money. 

I want the erroneous information from XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX to be removed.

The "" dispute '' function usually available for transactions was not available for these two transactions.",Credit card or prepaid card,"CITIBANK, N.A.",1
"On XX/XX/XXXX, I went into my local branch with a check over {$5000.00} payable to me from a well-known, well-established bank. I specifically asked about funds availability as my husband and I have a hard XX/XX/XXXX deadline to make a payment. I would have taken that check anywhere else if I had been told about a NINE-day hold on ALL funds. The bank associate made a phone call and said the funds would be released the next business day, which was interpreted as Tuesday XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ). 

On that day, the processing payment has turned into hold with ZERO availability until XX/XX/XXXX. 
This hold does not follow Regulation CC : If the total check deposits into one account on the same business day is over {$5000.00}, then {$200.00} must available on the first business day, {$600.00} on the second, {$4800.00} on the 3rd, and the remainder must be available on the 7th business day. 
Regulation CC stipulates four types of holds that a bank may place on a check deposit at its discretion. And yes we understand that each has its own qualifications and it is legal for the bank to place any type where the requirements are met. It is my belief that Bank of America has arbitrarily instructed a type of hold placed that holds the most funds the longest that can be applied legally. Furthermore, I believe in doing, the bank is way outside the scope of this funds availability law and to date has not provided a legitimate reason for holding on to ALL of our check. 
1 ) There is only one check processing region for the entire United States. Therefore, all checks are now local.

2 ) BOA associates will tell me the holds are placed "" for security reasons '' and "" federal law requires ( Reg CC ) all banks to have holds : but again no specifics are given.

3 ) I believe this "" deposit hold '' is a shell for floating our money by using it investing in short term investments.

My husband and I have spoken to several associates on the phone and no one gives names or employee numbers as a way of IDing or following up the chain to escalate properly, so we just get passed from person to person who read the same script without any accountability or problem-solving authority. ( None of the so-called NSF exceptions apply, neither for the amounts or the length of time ).

The depository bank has offered us NO reason to doubt the check is good. ( The paying bank already indicated the check funds were cleared.

The check was not postdated or stale dated and was NOT previously returned.

Large banks are using power and bureaucracy to violate consumer protections and hold account holder deposits hostage. Many of these banks have already been caught stealing from customers by assessed extended overdrawn balance charges that violate the National Bank Acts usury limit. Now we have a growing new assault : the absolute, multi-day deposit hold on consumer check deposits. 

Hiding behind imagined conspiracies and fraud, my own bank has delayed a legitimate lump sum payment check. For a bank that processes the accounts of millionaires, it seems egregious that a major retirement fund would be flagged for fraud. 

I have banked here off and on since XXXX. My husband has banked here since XXXX. We can not believe we are being treated this way.

"InXX/XX/XXXX, I started to receive calls regarding an old debt with XXXX that was taken out in XXXX, defaulted on in XXXX, and finally settled on in XXXX. Given the amount of time that had passed, I chalked the initial calls up to a scam or phantom debt collector but returned the call out of curiosity as they were claiming to be filing a "" civil complaint '' against me. At this time I advised the woman I spoke with that I did not owe the money and that it was settled back in XXXX and that I wanted them to provide proof of debt. She became combative and excessively tried to scare me with what the "" legal action '' means .... I informed her that I would gladly go to court regarding the matter at which point she hung up on me. I attempted to call back several times and was sent to a generic voicemail. I left a message on my 3rd attempt advising that I wanted to make sure that they had the right address on file so that I could be served and did not receive an immediate call back. I then contacted XXXX XXXX directly and was transferred to their Loss Mitigation department who advised me they sold my debt in XXXX. I contacted that debtor and they advised me the file transferred again in XXXX. I attempted to contact that debtor and was unable to reach them ( it appears they are no longer in business ). I settled my account with XXXX out of XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/ but was unable to make contact with them at the number provided on my letter from XXXX. 

The first time I had heard back from Jefferson and Associates was on XX/XX/ when a woman from "" XXXX XXXX XXXX  '' left me a voicemail indicating they attempted to deliver very important legal documents and received them back as undeliverable and if I wanted additional information regarding the urgent matter to call the "" Legal office '' back at XXXX and reference my case number. 

Since then, I have received countless calls all with slightly varying names of the company, case number, my name, and dates I have to respond by to prevent "" Legal Action ''. I have answered many of these calls and repeated the same information and requested proof of debt each time to no avail. The calls stop for a month or two after I speak with someone and then start back up. I have stopped answering or returning calls after my last interaction with a XXXX XXXX - Secretary with the filing department at XXXX, XXXX XXXX  XXXX ( name of company on VM received on XXXX ) also Secretary with the filing department at Jefferson and Associates ( Name of company on VM received on XXXX ). During my conversation with Ms. XXXX, I again informed her that I do not owe this debt and that they need to send proof of debt to me. At this time, she asked me to prove to her that I don't owe the debt at which time I expressed my concerns about sharing information given their phone numbers are generated by google and their business doesn't have a real website. She did state she would send me proof and confirmed my address but it was never received. 

I have received 4 voicemails since that interaction ; all of which are from Jefferson and Associates and stating that a civil complaint is being filed against me if I don't respond by the end of that business day. Some of these voicemails discuss how I have defaulted on my loan, provide the last 4 digits of my SSN, and state that they are pursuing my case to the fullest extent of the law. 

On XX/XX/, my father received a call from Jefferson and Associates advising him that they needed to contact me right away regarding a civil case filed against me and that they were trying to help me before it was too late. The feel of this call was that they were trying to scare him into thinking I was in some sort of trouble and pressure him into releasing my contact information. He did not provide them with my information but did call me very concerned that something was wrong. I have since advised him to ask them to not call him. 

On XX/XX/, I attempted to call Jefferson and Associates at the last number they provided to my father ( they have provided 4 different numbers to call back when leaving a voicemail ) and reached a woman who answered the phone "" This is XXXX ''. I asked her what company I had reached and she stated "" Jefferson and Associates law firm ''. She asked me for the case number I was calling in reference to which I provided. She then confirmed the name on the file and I asked for the business ' address, business license #, and a Bar number for the attorney. She then advised me that I could mail whatever correspondence I need to the address below but that she was an answering service and I would need to call during business hours in order to get the other information. I did some further research on the address and found that this is a virtual office where an individual can pay the company to forward their mail and answer their phone. 

In conclusion, I believe that Jefferson and Associates has not only been deceptive regarding them being a legitimate law firm and taking legal action against me but they have also refused to acknowledge and fulfill my many requests to provide proof of debt. The tone of the voicemails and the call to my father attempting to scare him into thinking I am in some sort of legal trouble is abusive. Additionally, the time that has passed since last payment ( assuming they don't know about my settlement in XXXX  of XXXX  ) Jefferson and Associates ' collection practices place them in violation of Time Barred Debt laws in the state of NV. I no longer owe this debt from XXXX and have done everything in my power to rectify this with Jefferson and Associates ; however, it appears that they will only stop once I agree to pay them.

"Please note I have upload complete letter in attachments. I copied and pasted for site. I apologize if anything is repeated. 




n XX/XX/XXXX I noticed a huge discrepancy with the balance of one of the  student loans that I co-signed for, for my niece XXXX XXXX. 


These loans were co-signed for In the time frame from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX I co-signed for three with Citibank then XXXX  student loans. Ever since XX/XX/XXXX I have had issues with these loans and incorrect payment handling because of these issues primarily I asked several times to be removed as co-signer It is important to note in addition to this I wanted to get payment history for all three loans corrected. All payments prior to XXXX buying one of the loans were made by one payment check and Citibank applied accordingly. Unless I received a collection call then I sent an additional payment. In XX/XX/XXXX I  developed a very rare illness and became XXXX so the stress of these calls was too much and I was too sick to investigate and argue most times. I would wait until I felt better and would reach out. 


For years I went unsuccessfully round and round with Citibank who refused to help and skirted the issues when I reported it to CFPB. In XXXX, Citibank sold two of the three loans to XX/XX/XXXXand again I filed a report with CFPB Citibank denied the payment issues and XXXX XXXX XXXX Executive Office of Customer Advocacy investigated it. He assigned two people to assist. I I sent years worth of payment history and he corrected my payment history and my credit reports. While I was working with his office in XXXX I heard again from XXXX XXXX who worked for XXXX Office at Citibank. Finally my payment history and my credit report were corrected. XXXX sent me the attached email and Citibank I took their word and verified my credit report. Bank automatically sent payments every month there after. 


In XX/XX/XXXX I got a call from XXXX about the one loan they were now servicing for Citibank. The balance compared to the other two loans to be triple. I had been paying fir almost 9 years at this point. I called XXXX and requested a complete payment history. XXXX responded with a very incomplete payment history and for only 2 years and said that they could only go back two years. That the other information was not available. All correspondence done via there online communication that message expire and are deleted So I pushed back and filed another CFPB claim. However, in the two years provided I could already see payments were missing. So I pushed harder to get A complete copy and I filed a complaint again. Again Citibank did not provide payment history information until I got the survey from CFPB asking if I was satisfied with Citibank response. This is when I received the payment history and letter from Citibank dated XX/XX/XXXX. Packaged included Citibanks payment Audit trail from XX/XX/XXXX to current in addition with the cover letter from XXXX. This audit trail is dated XX/XX/XXXX. This audit trail is completely inaccurate and fortunately I still have a copy of the audit trail of all payments received on all three loans that I provided to XXXX in XXXX. 


Attached you will find a letter from Citibank and its from XXXX again the same lady I worked with in XXXX who promised that she corrected this payment history and she definitely fixed my credit reports. However, her audit trail provided on XXXX XXXX tells me otherwise as far as loan balance, fees and intentionally not applying or correcting payments. 




In her letter she states I was denied from being released as a co-signer because a payment for XX/XX/XXXX was not received however you can clearly see in XXXX XXXX audit trail it was received on XXXX XXXX. On this letter XXXX also very clearly states Citi co-signer release policy. Her policy is worded very different then the actual policy that XXXX XXXX copied and pasted in his official guidelines. In XXXX XXXX letter he confirms no late payments were made in XX/XX/XXXXHistory it shows a forbearance. That Citibank omits. This as well. He also clearly states the need for Citibank to correct there payment history as well. 




A comparison of payments on both audit trail Citibank History/Versus XXXX. Remember XX/XX/XXXX loans were Citibank until XXXX one check. 

Missing payments on Citibank XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Citibank suggested XX/XX/XXXX to use their online payment system to ensure on time and were correctly applied 5 of these payments from this system not on Citibank audit trail. We tried several times and we tried to set up auto pay to get a reduction in interest rate but this was very undependable and system would become inaccessible for periods of times You can see today that Most of these payments are not in Citibank History. See screen shot of payment history that I took in XXXX and compare it to Citibank Audit trail dated XX/XX/XXXX The first payment XX/XX/XXXX payment not accounted for anywhere on XXXX or Citibank. Ten dollars from millions of customers is free money. 

Date discrepancys like XXXX on site Citibank audit trail XX/XX/XXXX are all of this history for loans that interest is calculated daily the applied date is very important to the consumer. 

XX/XX/XXXX. Paid on line not on audit trail provided by Citibank {$410.00} XX/XX/XXXX paid online not on audit audit trail provided by Citibank. 





I continued to receive calls and emails so I then made multiple payments but collection calls and emails did not stop. 



The following are missing payments XXXX and XXXX XXXX audit trail contains but Citibank doesnt. received them letter from XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX audit trail contains proof of the following payments That Citibank has not applied on their XX/XX/XXXX audit trail. 

XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX And note there was extra payments made in between. The expense involved and time to go through almost ten years of bank detail will be pursued when the FTC requires this additional information. 

Looking at the bottom of XXXX audit trail XX/XX/XXXX payment was received on XX/XX/XXXX. Meaning after their XXXX investigation I was two months ahead in payments. 


However none the less collection calls persisted and collection emails did too see XXXX XXXX email. 


And when I couldnt get Citibank to fix unapplied payments I made several extra payments XX/XX/XXXX to preserve my credit. XXXX sent confirmation of their payments received them in letter Dated XXXX XXXX. 




The missing payments on Citibanks audit trail provided XX/XX/XXXX continued for XXXX Not applied XXXX payments XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Unapplied or misapplied payments continued XXXX Missing payments XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX In XXXX XXXX was hired to handle Citibanks loans however the audit trail says converted to XXXX and my first interaction in XXXX with Citibank they acted as if this was no longer their loan. Call XXXX not our problem. On their audit trail note the wording on XX/XX/XXXX converted to XXXX. The word convert implies a change like XXXX now owns the loan which is what Citibank implied to me as well on phone giving me the constant run around but XXXX was very clear that they did not own the loan. 


XXXX of XXXX collections calls started again I found out that Citibank was not forwarding payments to XXXX as they communicated they would. See letter from them with bad information. 


Missing payments and copies of cashed checks provided XXXX XXXX. Not applied XXXX XXXX Was applied XXXX XXXX Not applied XXXX XXXX Not applied. 




I have retrieved what I believe is sufficient documentation of Citibank deceptive practices. I have thousands of dollars in missing payments. They have knowing changed my payment history. They have refused to investigate and correctly apply missing payments. They have denied me to released as a co-signer on this loan for a missing payment that they knowingly received. Citibanks wording on there letter makes it seem like if you are ever late on a payment you can not release co-signer where as XXXX XXXX documentation clearly states 48 consecutive payments In addition I am filing another complaint with CFPB to ensure this matter is corrected. Other wise I will take to FTC via an attorney. I am sending this to you for action and accountability. I am also sending all this detail to FTC I want this investigated and criminal charges filed.

"I have banked with BofA for over 5 years. I have already opened new accounts and XXXX XXXX XXXX and will absolutely be closing my BofA account as they have a significant history of cheating with respect to overdraft fees, and how they process charges. 
Years ago, I availed myself of the "" account management '' tools which they tout to be useful tools for managing your account. Up until this point, I had not had issue with those account tools working. By design, when my account balance falls below 25.00 I am supposed to be notified. In this instance, those tools didnt work and to be honest, I am at a loss as to why. I had a credit card payment set to clear my account on the XXXX. According to BofA the charge posted to my account on the 30th. I never received an email or text message alert. The charge would have most assuredly overdrawn my account and should have triggered a notification to me so that I could react to the charge.That didnt happen, and as of this morning ( XX/XX/2019 I still have not received a notification ). 

My paycheck conveniently posts to my account on the last day of the month in this instance, the check was available in my account at midnight ( on the XXXX  ) although when I called BofA they explained even though they had my funds, my employer instructed that I am not to have access to my funds until the XXXX  and so the payment was returned ... ..

Officially, BofA returned my payment for insufficient funds. My complaints are as follows : 1. BofA was in posession of more than sufficient funds to cover the transaction for which they returned. This transaction should not have been returned, and I would like a statement from the institution so that my creditor does not hold that returned check against me.

2. I would like BofA to do a better job in the disclosure of their account management features so that unknowing customers such as myself are not relying on those alerts to prevent issues such as this.

3. I would like BofA to provide more clarity as to how they determine which charges will be covered through overdraft protection and which ones will not be ; to include specifics related to the type of account, years customer has been with BofA, number of overdraft fees, bounced checks etc in customers history as right now, it appears that the the determination to cover overdraft charges is arbitraily made by unknown person ( s ) without a solid non-discriminatory policy. I personally have clients and colleagues who bank with BofA and they report very different experiences in how returned processing, overdraft fees, and availability of deposits are handled. 

It should be noted that my husband and I have over 14000.00 deposited across BofA checking accounts each month, and at the time this transaction posted my husband had enough funds in his account to cover my transaction. The point for mentioning this is that I had access to money to quickly deposit in my account had I known the account was overdrawn. My assumption was the payment will post on the 30th, my paycheck will post on the 30th, the check will clear. This matter was not for lack of funds available to me, it resulted from lack of funds available in this account which could have easily been corrected in minutes had the account management tools, for which I relied on actually worked. If I STILL need to log in to my account every day and look at the account balance because BofA intends to send the alerts at their discretion then that should be clearly disclosed in lamens terms not in small print in documents which are never provided to the consumer.",Checking or savings account,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",3

Between the misplacement of our financial documents and the poor communication from XXXX XXXX/Loan Care, it is clear that they simply do not want to review our file for a possible work-out solution. 

The events described above are just a sample of the practices that are taking place at XXXX XXXX/Loan Care. They appear to be more interested in foreclosing on my home and fire selling it at auction to make a profit. It appears that their lack of participation in a meaningful modification review of our file indicates a preference to profit directly from our hardships.

"I have provided a brief summary below. See attached for a detailed timeline of events. 


In XXXX XXXX XXXX after having a purchase offer for a new home accepted, I began comparison shopping for mortgage lenders. On XX/XX/XXXX, after receiving a loan estimate from a loan officer at Better Mortgage, I informed the loan officer that I would be using Better Mortgage as my lender. For the next several weeks, Better Mortgage continuously stated that everything was going as planned, only to back out of the loan on the day that the loan closing disclosure documents needed to be provided in order to close the loan on time. Better Mortgage informed me that they were choosing not to fund the loan at this time because the closing date was more than 90 days before I was scheduled to start a new job. Throughout the process, I was honest and forthcoming with my employment situation and specifically explained it to a loan officer on XX/XX/XXXX. 


I was employed at Job 1 [ employer name withheld ] and living and working in XXXX XXXX   when I applied for the loan, but had accepted a job offer at Job 2 [  employer name withheld ] in XXXX when I applied for the mortgage. The start date for Job 2 is XX/XX/2019. The home we were purchasing is in XXXX. I was working at Job 1 at the scheduled close date and for several months afterward ( until at least XX/XX/XXXX ). There was no lapse in employment between Job 1 and Job 2. Each job pays a salary well in excess of what I needed to qualify for the mortgage. 


While it is obviously within Better Mortgages rights to reject an application, they chose to wait until the eleventh hour to inform me of their unwillingness to fund my mortgage. It is unclear whether this was due to intentional misrepresentation or gross incompetence. I believe that Better Mortgage may have been in violation of Title 12,  Section 1014.3 ( q ), which prohibits a lender from making a material misrepresentation concerning the consumer 's ability or likelihood to obtain any mortgage credit product or term On Sunday, XX/XX/XXXX, after it became clear that Better Mortgage would not fund the loan for several more weeks, I followed the advice of my realtor and began working with XXXX XXXX. The lending officer at XXXX sent me the closing disclosure documents for a XXXX XXXX-conforming mortgage on XX/XX/XXXX, while my start date for my new job was over 90 days away. There were no date restrictions on the disclosure document, and the loan closed on XX/XX/XXXX. When I chose to use XXXX XXXX, I was under a major time crunch because I did not want the sellers to back out of the sale. As a result, I was unable to comparison shop and was forced to accept a higher interest rate and higher closing costs.",Mortgage,"Better Mortgage, Inc.",2

"I purchased a XXXX XXXX toddler ride-on two-seat car from XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2019 with my Chase Amazon Visa card. The total amount for the car was {$480.00}. The item arrived on XX/XX/2019. On XX/XX/2019, the box was opened and the ride-on car was assembled, per the instructions. The ride-on car did not work/drive as stated. I contacted Amazon on XX/XX/2019 to report the defective item and request a return shipping label/replacement. I was asked if the box was damaged and I told them there were two small holes punched in the box ( it looked like for carrying as the box is large ) but I wasn't certain that the holes had anything to do with why it was defective. I was given the phone number to the seller ( XXXX XXXX ) to contact them as well ; Amazon sent them an email. The seller responded and asked for photos. I sent the photos back via e-mail on XX/XX/2019. On XX/XX/2019, I had not heard back from the seller so I called Amazon again. Another e-mail was sent to the seller. I called Amazon back because the email sent had incorrect information on it. I asked for a shipping label. So Amazon sent a 2nd email to correct the information and I was instructed by Amazon to call back and file an A-Z Claim if I don't hear back by Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX didn't hear back. I called Amazon on  Tuesday XX/XX/2019 as the seller did not respond to our request for a return shipping label. I requested to file an A-Z Claim. Later that day, I called Chase to ask how long I should wait, if Amazon doesn't resolve my issue, to file a dispute with my card. The woman I spoke with advised me to file now, so I did. I was not asked for any information or documentation at that time. She said she took good notes and that was all that was needed. I called Chase again the following week, wither on XX/XX/XXXX or XXXX to check the status. I was informed that nothing was needed from me and that I would be contacted if something was needed. 

On XX/XX/2019 the seller contacted me on my work phone. They were notified of the A-Z claim and told me to keep the product, close the A-Z claim and then when they verify it was closed, they would issue me a refund. Since that seemed odd, I contacted Amazon. I spoke to a manager ( XXXX ) who stated they shouldn't be calling me and that Amazon would contact them and tell them to stop. She also said if I close it, I could not re-open the claim. The next day, I received a voicemail from the seller stating that they checked and the claim wasn't closed and to call them when it's closed. 

I decided to call Chase on XX/XX/2019 to check the status of the dispute as I hadn't heard anything. I spoke to a supervisor, XXXX, who said my claim was denied because they received the seller 's response on XX/XX/2019 ; they state that they sent me a letter on XX/XX/2019 and that because I didn't respond by XX/XX/2019 they denied my dispute and closed my case. After asking questions about re-opening the dispute, XXXX finally answered that I could put it in writing to request my dispute be reopened. Since I never received anything in writing to request this information, I printed off all the e-mails and documentation as well as provided a narrative of events. The 78 page PDF was faxed to Chase ( attn XXXX ) on XX/XX/2019 ( I have the fax transmittal showing it went through ). On XX/XX/2019, I called Chase to verify that it was received and was told it was received in its entirety. I told Chase I would call next week to get an update. The letter from Chase with the seller 's response dated XX/XX/2019 indicated "" This buyer did not request to return product back, simply kept the {$450.00} item and opened a charge back. '' The sellers answers to the questions "" Return Requested : false ; Replacement Requested : false ''. That is not a true statement as I provided the e-mails from  Amazon 's staff to the seller on XX/XX/2019 requesting a return/replacement ; multiple e-mails after that date from Amazon to the seller requesting a return ; and an e-mail that an Amazon Manager sent to me indicating that the seller has not been  cooperative and has not authorized a return/label. I was told that Visa rules state that if I am sent a defective item not as described, I should not have to pay to return the item. Amazon told me that the seller needed to "" authorize '' the return as well and that the seller needed to provide a shipping label. 

I contacted Chase on XX/XX/2019. I spoke to Raven who told me that my case was denied a second time. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was put on the line with XXXX. After explaining my story again, XXXX indicated that she would "" expedite '' this to be reviewed and it would take 7-10 days. After that call, my sister instructed me to call back as the deadline to "" file '' is the following day. When I made the XXXX call, where XXXX stated there were no notes that it was being expedited for review. I told XXXX that I would be filing a complaint with the CFPB because I didn't know what else to do. I called the next day and spoke with the supervisor, XXXX XXXX, who said there was nothing he could do to re-open it and he doesn't see any notes about the dispute being expedited or looked at. It was requested that XXXX send this to his supervisor, which he refused to escalate this to his manager. When asked for his managers contact information, XXXX gave the mailing address for the Executive Office. 

I've exhausted all of my options as I have made multiple calls to Amazon and to Chase, as well as spoken to the seller ( who falsely identified themselves as the shipper, not the seller ). The box has been in my living room packed up and ready to go since XX/XX/2019. I've even offered to drive it the 45 minutes to the Amazon Fulfillment Center closest to my home ( Amazon wouldn't take it they said because it's a 3rd party seller ). I am also planning to send in my documentation to the Chase Executive Offices and ask that they pull all of the recorded calls, as I was given inconstant facts and information from customer service staff ( as well as supervisor 's ) in the disputes department as well as untrue information. I requested that someone from the Executive Offices contact me and that didn't happen. It's my opinion that  Chase failed to do their due diligence and dispute this charge as a not as described item. Chase did not tell me what documentation was needed up front, if any. I never received anything in writing requesting any documentation. Per Chase, they state they mailed me a letter after the merchant had already declined the dispute. I never received that letter. The information that I received from Chase has been inconsistent ( dates, time periods to process or filing dates ). In my opinion, Chase has not done their fiduciary duty. This purchase was defective ; I have verification/documentation that I attempted to get the item back to the seller within the return policy/period and worked with Amazon to resolve this issue as well. I've attempted to cooperate with Chase to resolve this and have been met with challenging and inconsistent customer service to say the least.",Credit card or prepaid card,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,1

"Over the past several years, I have made multiple requests to my mortgage lender, Freedom Mortgage, to drop private mortgage insurance from my monthly statements. I have never missed a payment in the 9 years of the loan and actually reduced the LTV on the mortgage to below 78 % years ahead of schedule. Today, the LTV on the loan is 71 %, but Freedom Mortgage refuses to drop PMI unless I pay for an appraisal proving my home 's value ( which has only increased over the years ). I have repeatedly refused to pay for an appraisal, because my understanding is that PMI must be removed automatically at 78 % LTV, which was achieved approximately 3 years ago. At {$86.00} per month, I've paid over {$3000.00} in additional PMI since it should have been removed. In hindsight, an appraisal would have cost me much less, though it isn't required once LTV reaches 78 %, and I don't want to give Freedom Mortgage the satisfaction of bullying me into another unnecessary expense.",Mortgage,Freedom Mortgage Company,2
"HomPlease review document below to show that previous loan was held and serviced by Homebridge. It is very concerning that no one was able to find this information and goes to more on why there is still a significant portion of our original escrow account that is missing. If customer service is unable To find customer documentation it raises questions on what other things are not being done especially with the issues I have been reporting for awhile now about how a huge portion of our escrow account has gone missing with no explanation from Homebridge, your loan officer or affiliates on where our money went. 

Homebridge held out first mortgage when we purchased our first home in XXXX of XXXX and we refinanced with Homebridge and their loan brokers in XXXX of XXXX. At the time we had an Escrow Account of over $ 6k and our Homebridge loan officer and notary both had told us our escrow account of $ 6k+ would transfer over to the new loan. I have included text messages and communication of the confirmation of transfer of funds. We are going on months with no explanation of where the funds have gone and now no more communication from any of the parties involved. We then decided to escalate the complaint with Homebridge customer service as our Homebridge loan broker stopped responding after telling us it was originally transferring over and that we would get a breakdown report. Homebridge customer service has been just as bad in communicating and getting us a breakdown of what happened to our escrow account as there is over $ 5k+ missing that has been unaccounted for and no explanation of where it is after we were told it was going to be transferred over. They opened our new Homebridge Escrow account with {$960.00} which doesn't account for the rest of the funds and never received a breakdown after being told it would transfer over. Have been going back and forth with Homebridge and no accountability or any communication, instead they tell us that they never held the first loan which is a sad state of their records as we had our first mortgage with them and refinanced with homebridge and have documentation to show both. We are first time home borrowers and Homebridge has been nothing but a nightmare to deal with, should have never refinanced with them as we were lied to and no one takes any ownership or is willing to help instead denies factual evidence that they have always been our lender for both mortgages. We had a problem with them earlier in the year which Homebridge customer service denied after months of nightmares dealing with their customer service. At that occurence we had to file a claim with the CFPB and we were ruled in our favor but it wasn't until then that they took ownership. Again we are asking for your help as Homebridge has since locked us out of accessing past records for our old loan but I still have copies and have included them in the attachments. They have lied and said they didn't hold the first loan which they did and most importantly we have never been told what happened to our $ XXXX extra in our escrow account and they have provided no records or help in finding it most likely taking it as an unauthorized commission.",Mortgage,"HOMEBRIDGE FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC.",2

"The complaint I am presenting involves U.S. BANK, specifically unsecured credit, which I currently owe as the sole debtor of a U.S. BANK credit card account. 

The issue with U.S. BANK is that I have no way of paying my credit card bill, which I owe them. 

Before XX/XX/2020, I had never missed a single payment. Preceding XX/XX/2020, I had made all payments, consecutively, concerning my U.S. BANK credit card account debt via auto-pay ; this payment toward my unsecured credit was executed utilizing my checking account. 

During XX/XX/2020, I began the process of separation and divorce, which required that I change my personal debit card account number ; this account number was utilized to make my auto-pay payments to U.S. BANK. Needless to say, I was only several days short of my debt remittance, at which point U.S. BANK immediately sent the debt to collections. 

To cure this discrepancy regarding my, payment details ( specifically the change in my personal checking account card number ), I attempted to access my U.S. BANK online portal account. However, because my U.S. BANK debt had been sent to collections, U.S. BANK removed my ability to access this online portal account. 

Without access, I next called the U.S. BANK 's customer service phone number ( listed on the back of my U.S. BANK credit card ). The first call I made to this customer service number took a mere twenty minutes to reach the customer service representative. Unfortunately, U.S. BANK 's general customer service department could not fix this account issue as only the U.S. BANK collections department has the ability to assist me with such a problem ; this information is the limited information the general customer service department could provide me. So, kindly, the customer service representative transferred me to collections. I waited on hold for two hours and forty-five minutes to speak with the U.S. BANK collections department, and at the forty-sixth minute, the call cut  off. 

I have repeated this process of calling the U.S. BANK customer service phone number twenty-three times as of today ; this "" process '' referring to being transferred to collections, remaining on hold for periods which range from one hour to nearly three hours, only to never speak with a single person from the collections department. 

At this point, I do not know what to do. All I want is to pay my bill ... and the longer I wait, the more my credit score is damaged, as well as late fees are being added which require more countless hours, I can only assume at this point, of waiting on hold to then explain the reasoning for the necessary late fee removals. 

Also, I should mention that I have not received a single call from U.S. BANK, nor an email, nor a letter, which would allow me to pay my unsecured debt, which I currently owe as the sole debtor of this U.S. BANK credit account. As far as any contact what so ever from U.S.BANK ... I did receive an email in mid-XX/XX/2020 that my XX/XX/2020 payment did not execute via auto-pay, which was the notification that initiated this process I have relayed. 

ALL I WANT IS TO PAY MY BILL. 

PLEASE HELP.",Debt collection,U.S. BANCORP,0
"This saga started in XX/XX/XXXX, when I called LoanCare to determine the amount of refund we should expect from our Borrower-paid Single-premium PMI policy if we refinanced our loan and paid off the balance serviced by LoanCare. It took several calls to get any kind of answer, and then they told me I had to call the actual insurance company to get that amount. I called that company, and they laughed at me. "" You are not our customer. We will only talk to LoanCare. '' Subsequent to the XX/XX/XXXX payoff of our loan via that refinancing, LoanCare is refusing to respond to repeated inquiries about the status of the refund of the unearned premiums due us from our single-premium borrower-paid PMI policy. This is in direct violation of the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998. Here is the specific language from the HPA : "" After informing the mortgage insurer of cancellation or termination, you must send notice to the borrower that you canceled or terminated PMI. You must send this notice not later than 30 days after you have canceled or terminated PMI. The mortgage insurer then has 30 days to return any unearned premiums to you. You, in turn, have 45 days to return the unearned premiums to the borrower. '' No notice has been sent by LoanCare, and they are refusing to acknowledge that they have any obligations to do so. 

Multiple emails ( attached below ) were ignored, and when I finally reached "" XXXX '' by phone ( on XX/XX/XXXX ), she clearly didn't understand what a single-premium PMI policy is ( despite being in LoanCare 's "" insurance '' group ). After first telling me that we received a "" PMI refund '' as part of our escrow refund ( which we did not ), she put me on hold again -- returning to tell me that there is no refund due for our policy. I asked for documentation for why that is the case, and she promised that I would be receiving that by COB.

"I checked my credit report in XX/XX/XXXX and noticed a collections debt that I had no prior knowledge of. I had not been given due process/notification via phone, email or mail that I owed stated debt by XXXX or I.Q Data International. 

Due to that fact I began to dispute it citing fraud. I finally received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX from I.Q. Data International , Inc. stating that they would investigate my fraud claim if I provided certain information such as police reports, copy of my valid government issued Id and proof of residency at said time fraud occurred. 

I believed it to be fradulent initially because I had not been notified or given due process by XXXX or I.Q. Data International notifying me of the debt. The debt just appeared out of nowhere on my credit report. Only when I noticed it on my credit report and disputed it as fraud did they reach out to contact me and notify me after the fact via mail of the said debt. 

At this time I wrote a letter to I.Q. Data International , Inc in response to their letter to me dated XXXX. I requested 1 ) debt validation and 2 ) to provide me with proof that they own or have been assigned the debt by the original creditor and have the legal authority to collect this debt in the state of TX. 

I received a letter from I.Q. Data International, Inc on XX/XX/XXXX. They provided 1 ) verification of the debt but failed to provide me with 2 ) proof that they own and/or have been assigned the debt by the original creditor and are legally authorised to collect this debt in the state of TX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I wrote a letter to I.Q. Data informing them of the missing information that they must provide to me legally. In the letter I informed them that if they did not provide me the information and continued to pursue collections efforts against me that they would be in violation of the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act.

Since sending that letter I have not received any further letters in attempts to collect this debt from me via mail but they continue to fradulently report to XXXX.

I have filed at least 4 disputes with XXXX  on this case. XXXX  has put that I dispute the case on my file however if the Collection Agency does not provide me with what I am due legally then they are in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and must remove this from my credit report and cease all future collection efforts. 

By law the agency after receiving my dispute must send me proof that it owns or has been assigned the debt by the original creditor, validation of the debt and proof that they are legally authorised to collect this debt in the state of TX. 

If this does not happen how do I know that the original creditor actually hired this company and this company is not trying to run a scam? What if I settle this dispute and another collection agency contacts me claiming that I owe this debt to them? Without providing me this proof all settlement attempts on my end to provide a pay in lieu of deletion have been stalled due to their negligence, fraud and abuse. 

If this collection agency is not fradulent or a scam why have they discontinued pursuing further collections via mail with me yet continue to report this fradulent debt to the credit bureau?",Debt collection,"I.Q. DATA INTERNATIONAL, INC.",0

"Consumer Finance Protection Bureau Complaint filed XX/XX/2019 - I was purchasing airline tickets from XXXX today, XX/XX/XXXX, and in the purchase screen was an option to apply for a Delta Gold Sky Miles AmEx card, which, if approved and used for this purchase, would qualify for a {$250.00} statement credit in 8-12 weeks. 
- I selected the option, which opened a clearly labeled third-party popup screen, through which I read the terms and completed the application. In that popup I quickly received notification that I had been approved, downloaded a PDF with my new card number and temporary CID code, and selected a check box to have my credit card information sent to XXXX to "" complete my transaction. '' I have a screenshot of this. 
- The popup timed out and closed and the XXXX   checkout screen refreshed, populated with the new credit card information. 
- I rechecked the info and clicked Process Payment, but got an error message saying that the "" credit card ID number '' was invalid. I have a screenshot of this. I re-entered the credit card information, processed again, and got a popup window saying that XXXX did not accept temporary credit card numbers and would deny travel if I showed up at the airport without the physical card used to purchase the tickets and photo ID. 
- I called the AmEx customer service number on the new card PDF and was told that the charge for the tickets had been approved, multiple times, and that I might need to expedite delivery of the card to have it in time for my flight. AmEx agent XXXX told me this was a "" known issue '' and to contact XXXX Global Ticketing. She provided a number. 
-I called XXXX global ticketing, held for 30 minutes, spoke with XXXX , who located the attempted transaction with my Sky Miles number, and tried to process it again with the new credit card info. She got the same error message. She then created a new transaction and tried again. Same error, but she saved the record, and told me to contact AmEx to see why it wouldn't go through, and to call back to complete the transaction. 
- I called AmEx customer service again, this time spoke with XXXX, who transferred me to New Accounts. The rep in New Accounts said he was not the right person and transferred me back to Customer Service, where a rep named XXXX eventually said that I would need to have XXXX  contact AmEx to complete the transaction, and he gave me an AmEx number to give XXXX. 
- I called XXXX again, held for 30 minutes again, spoke with XXXX, who said she could not contact AmEx, the problem was a "" known issue '' in XXXX   ticketing, and I should call AmEx New Accounts because XXXX had determined that AmEx was issuing erroneous temporary CID codes with these credit cards and that's why the transactions were rejected. 
- I called AmEx New Accounts, spoke with XXXX, waited on hold 10 minutes, got transferred to XXXX, who told me that multiple charges for the tickets had been approved, but that if they weren't going through because XXXX was rejecting the temporary CID, it meant I couldn't make a purchase until I had the physical card in hand. She put me on hold for another 10 minutes, then told me that I could request expedited delivery of the card if I called back tomorrow, but she couldn't enter that request today. She said to call XXXX in the meanwhile to request that they put my transaction on hold until the card arrives "" since it's their fault you can't buy the tickets now. '' - I accessed my online AmEx account and discovered that there were 14 pending transactions from XXXX on the new apparently unusable card, all for the same amount. XXXX?! I have a screenshot of this. 
- I called XXXX ticketing, waited on hold for 20 minutes, and was told by XXXX that the pending charges would drop in 1-2 days and that the valid transaction could be put on hold for 6 calendar days to give time for the card to arrive. That's the potential resolution for this situation : hope the purchase can be made with the physical card 's CID number. 
- I am filing a complaint because I applied for this credit card, advertised as usable for a same-day transaction upon approval, and after being approved, it was not usable for the transaction the same day. Worse, it took me 3 hours of calling customer service lines for two companies to get to a potential resolution ( time will be the tell if it works ) despite the fact that my problem with this Delta Gold Sky Miles AmEx card is apparently a "" known issue '' at both companies. If it's a "" known issue, '' why are XXXX and AmEx still advertising this product as usable for same-day purchases? Do they make extra money off of me spending 3 hours of my day calling their customer service lines? The only reason I applied for this card was to use it for a same-day purchase that would qualify for a statement credit. If I had known what a hassle this would be, I obviously would have found another solution to purchase these tickets. 
- Sidenote : why am I getting these plane tickets? Because I need to attend my grandmother 's funeral a thousand miles away. That reason doesn't make these companies any more culpable, but it contextualizes my level of effort and grievance.",Credit card or prepaid card,AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,1

After that year, any unpaid amount would start incurring interest. I made all my payments on time and I kept using the credit card for other purchases. When the promotion ended, Best Buy charged me interest for the year I had the promotion. I called them to figure out why they charged me for the promotional time and they said that was the deal.

"I, XXXX XXXX, opened up a Business Credit Card ( my company name is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) using my Tax ID number, my SS # as well as my business partners SS # In XX/XX/XXXX. My old business partner, XXXX XXXX, left the business. During the time we removed him from the ( approx in XX/XX/XXXX ) business we ( myself, XXXX, and my wife ) went in persons to the Suntrust Branch and explained the situation. They said they had removed him from the systems and at that time also added my wife, XXXX XXXX. They informed us that me and my wife would now be financially responsible after removing XXXX. The card was in the Business name and Tax ID. My wife and I being listed as personal guarantee. The card had been opened and in good standing for 10 plus years. 

My wife and I moved primary residences on XX/XX/XXXX. We put in a change of address with the Post Office and directly with all of our creditors, including Suntrust. I contacted Suntrust after the move to pay off the card. The balance given was the balance I paid and they assured me I had a XXXX balance. 

My wallet was stolen on XX/XX/XXXX shortly after moving into my new home. There were 2 fraudulent charges from a XXXX station in XXXX, GA. I called Suntrust around XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to report the card stolen. I confirmed my new address and closed the card at that time because I was in business for myself at that time. I advised I had a police report with XXXX GA police as well as surveillance information at the XXXX. The representative told me they would take care of the erroneous theft charges, close the card and confirmed my address. 


In XX/XX/XXXX, I was given the opportunity to reopen my business in a different line of work. I went back to Suntrust to open a new business card on XX/XX/XXXX. I thought that since I had tenure with this company and had no issues that it would be the easiest to open a new checking business account as well as credit card. I filled out the necessary paperwork and they informed me they would process the application and be in touch shortly. 

I received a call from my old business partner on XX/XX/XXXX. He said on XX/XX/XXXX Suntrust took {$320.00} out of his mothers Money Market Savings Account. On the statement it says ST Right of Offset Payment XXXX. He spoke with Suntrust directly and was told it was a charge off for a credit card. He was a personal guarantor on the account. His mother has him listed on her Accounts so they took the money from her. As I stated above, he was no longer on the account. He reimbursed his mother for the money that was taken from her account and I reimbursed him. 

I was alarmed when hearing this as I have prided my self for keeping my accounts current and had been a good account holder with Suntrust. At no time had I received a statement/bill from Suntrust at my old residence where the bills were sent prior to me moving in XX/XX/XXXX, nor did I receive anything at my new residence. Not did anyone mention anything to me when I called about the stolen card. 

XX/XX/XXXX. I went to the Suntrust Branch @ XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, GA to see what the problem was. I spoke with XXXX XXXX. I checked to see if they had my current address which he confirmed. He was very nice and tried to help figure this out. He gave me an XXXX number to call. They would not talk to me in the Branch. If they could not figure it out he said to come back. I go to my house and immediately call the XXXX number. After being transferred numerous times to different departments and accomplishing nothing, I gave up. I was going back to the Branch And try to get it resolved. He mentioned something about charges for late fees and bills being sent to my old place of business address which I had not been at for years and never receive mail at that location. When I was at that place of business I was having my mail sent to a P.O. Box. I never had it sent to the actual place of business. I had not been at that location since early XX/XX/XXXX!!! 

XX/XX/XXXX. I received a letter from Suntrust declining me for a new Business Credit Card. It stated that My credit score was XXXX but I had Derogatory Business Credit and Poor Credit Performance with Suntrust. I had nothing negative on my personal or business credit. 

XX/XX/XXXX. I went back to the Suntrust at XXXX XXXX XXXX. I spoke with XXXX XXXX. She called the department she needed and they were closed on weekends. She asked me to come back during the week. 

XX/XX/XXXX. Spoke with XXXX XXXX at the Branch again. She called and was put on hold with Suntrust trying to figure out what was going on. She said that I had 5 different profiles on my Control Account. You are only suppose to have one profile. I assume that is why they were sending statements to the wrong address. XXXX XXXX gave me another XXXX number to call. I did so with the same results. I was on hold and transferred for 2 hours. I had some CSR saying it was a bogus charge and should be resolved and Id get transferred to someone else. The bogus charge was explained as late fees for the erroneous charges from the theft of my card reported in XX/XX/XXXX. The last CSR I spoke with said it was again for a late fee and was turned down for a credit card but was sarcastic in tone as if I was having trouble understanding. I told him I did not owe a late fee. 

After documenting my series of events recently with Suntrust here is what I do know ... .I have no idea why they have me with 5 controller accounts. I am don't understand why they would attempt or say they were sending bills at one time to my old place of business when I never received mail at that location, I used a P.O. Box. After calling in to pay off an account in XX/XX/XXXX I NEVER used that card for anything. As I stated I had it closed shortly after paying it off because of the theft and was not actively in business for myself. If I owed a late fee or any charges for that matter, I contact them several times and something could have been said to me. I am also unsure of why I NEVER received a bill at either my old or new primary residence. I happen to stay in touch with the new home owners of my old residence and they have not received any mail for me from Suntrust. I don't ' know if they even know how to track the supposed charges back to see where they stem from correctly. If these were late fees for a theft I wasn't responsible for, why would they not credit these charges? Instead they have transferred me and have given me no assurance that anyone from their company has the slightest interest in finding out what really happened with my account, why it happened, apologize and even try to attempt to make it right. Ive worked very hard to have a good credit rating. In XX/XX/XXXX I paid them {$14000.00} to pay the card off and never used it again. I did not receive one statement or one phone call about owing any amount of money. Imagine if they treated every customer this way. How much money would they make with bogus charges. Not to mention the time Ive wasted on trying to get somebody to help resolve this issue. I had XXXX file a formal complaint with Suntrust which went no where and resolved nothing but wasting time. 

Since then on XX/XX/XXXX I received a VM from Executive Services @ XXXX XXXX. I called right back and shocking had to leave a message. On XX/XX/XXXX the Executive Services called and asked me to explain the situation. She said she would call me first of next week after she investigated. Again nothing ... 

On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I left voice messages with no return call on either message from Suntrust.

"This is the second time I have had this issue with this Bank. 

The problem is that they keep posting transactions in ways such that I will have an overdraft. 

Just two weeks ago, I paid my phone bill on a Friday when they were funds available to the account. 

The amount was {$170.00}. 

It stayed in the pending status for a couple of days, and then another transaction came through and they hit me with overdraft fees for, I believe two transactions. 

Just this Friday, a credit card payment was scheduled in the amount of {$38.00}. 

That means that the money was supposed to come out of the account at midnight on Thursday. And this payment was scheduled with the credit card company 3 days before the transaction was supposed to happen. 

In practice, what happened is they waited until Friday or Saturday night to post the transaction, at which point the account went into overdraft. 

If the payment had been set up for the proper time, then it would have taken away from the available balance on the account and the issue would have been solved.",Checking or savings account,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,3

"I have lived in my home for 15 years. I am a senior citizen. My loan was bought by Nationwide/Mr. Cooper some years back. I never had a problem with them until I refinanced this past XXXX to pay off some debt. Since refinancing I have had three major problems with this company and there has been no reasonable explanation for any of them. 

First I received a bill from the Town of XXXX that I was to pay my own taxes. My taxes have always been paid by my mortgager and nothing changed. I was told a 3rd party company XXXX sent the town the letter. No one had an explanation. I asked for a written response as to how this happened. I got an email saying the taxes were paid. I was never told why it happened in the first place. I received a letter saying as much and they told me that as of XX/XX/19 they still had not received my payment. My mortgage has always been paid directly to Mr. Cooper from my checking account on the first of every month. I checked with my bank and they said Mr. Cooper received the payment on the first as always. The letter from the XXXX XXXX Customer Relations Specialist who was very nasty and condesending told me my bill was not paid and showed me their statement saying it was posted on the XXXX and it was my problem. The bank confirmed for the 2nd time that they received it on time on the first and it was in internal problem with Mr. Cooper. They are jeopardizing my credit at this point. 

Then to make matters worse they send me a new bill now for {$690.00} instead of {$680.00} because they shorted my escrow account when they refinanced. Obviously to make the payments seem more reasonable than the other companies who were giving me their figures for refinancing. 

I do not know what is wrong with this company but something has dramatically changed and someone needs to look into them. I do not want to stay with them at this point but I would have to pay closing costs all over again to go somewhere else.

3 ) PHH Mortgage, formerly Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC realized in late XX/XX/XXXX that the final modification was not delivered to Mr. XXXX. PHH Mortgage allegedly then issued the final modification agreement in late XXXX and asked for Mr. XXXX to send back immediately.

5 ) When Mr. XXXX contested PHH Mortgage actions his funds were returned, and PHH has continued to push the sale date of XX/XX/XXXX. 

6 ) The actions of PHH Mortgage are consistent with Dual Tracking. Dual tracking occurs when a mortgage servicer continues to foreclose on a borrower 's home while simultaneously considering the borrower 's application for a loan modification or other foreclosure avoidance option. In addition, PHH Mortgage violates the rule of RESPA AND ECOA, while failing to properly and timely provide Mr. XXXX with required documentation to complete modification, while discriminating against Mr. XXXX by not accepting said agreement. This practice violates federal law ( 12 C.F.R. 1024.41 ) which ; The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was established by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, issued mortgage servicing rules that, after being codified into federal law, went into effect as of XX/XX/XXXX.

"When your own personal bank freezes you out And doesn't even have the politeness to inform you at any point! 

In particular in this age of coronavirus, when nobody really wants to take your cash, touch those bills and or receive any in return your credit card, your debit card takes on extra importance. When suddenly and mysteriously the spigot to your own funds is turned off, how does that make you feel? We all talk about "" rights '', what about the right to access your own money and use it when, how, and if you need. 

Santander Bank has done that to me for the last week, unabated, despite three personal visits to one of the few remaining branches open, multiple phone calls to various units including the fraud-team within the bank 's "" back offices ''. 

All this came about not for any actual fraud, but for a minor error for which I ran into the bank ASAP to explain. Instead of grabbing a check for my business account to deposit into my personal account, I effectively made the "" short-circuit '' mistake of grabbing a check from that very same personal account to deposit into it. This is akin to taking money from your left pocket and attempting to put it in your right. The check was for more than the account held, so became an issue. If it had been for a lesser amount, I'm not sure this would have mattered. 

In any event, I replaced the frivolous, supercilious yellow check with the correct ( pink ) "" BUSINESS '' check and all should have been good, particularly after I explained it to the bank manager, but no, there apparently the troubles only began. It was fully 10 days before the account was unfrozen. The fraud investigator was very polite and told me today that he only just today ( 10 days after the fact! ) received the matter on his desk. So my account was frozen and the actual complaint sat in limbo within the maze of the banks communication system without ever coming to anybodys attention for 10 days while my account was unusable. This is derelict. 

They have no right to essentially take my money and not give me access to it without informing me in the first place, telling me Im under investigation in any way, delineating the problem or explaining the timetable for its rectification. If there had been some type of fraud, wouldn't it have been nice if they had told thhe customer, me, that there was something fishy? Other credit card and bank accounts always do that if somebody's trying to finagle money out of your account from XXXX or XXXX or something. I received precisely ZERO messages of any kind, no texts, no emails, no phone calls NOTHING telling me that the account had been frozen and certainly nothing telling me why or for how long or what manner of recourse there was. 

This is peremptory and meretricious on the banks part and clearly something is wrong with their communication system top to bottom, that it takes 10 days to adjudicate a matter that in actuality takes a few seconds to realize is "" nothing '', and for that entire time not to tell the customer anything at all despite the fact that he goes into the bank repeatedly to explain and then request opening of the account.

"Regarding USAA Federal Savings Bank I received a call from USAA ( representative sounded female ) on XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/2019 at XXXX PST. The rep told me that my checking account has been locked due to fraudulent activity. I asked her what the activity was and she stated that she did not have access to that information and that I would need to call back after XXXX during normal business hours to get more information and unlock it. 
I called back on Thursday morning XX/XX/2019. I was told by the rep that I needed to change my PIN. I did this. 
I logged in to my account to find that my account had been thoroughly wiped out and used as a platform for fraudulent deposits ( about $ 39k ) and subsequent purchases ( $ 50k in debits ). There were at least 50 transactions processed in the window of time when the bank was closed. I had nothing to do with any of these and immediately called USAA back. The reps claimed I called USAA to have funds release and that I claimed they were valid. I made no such calls and have sent my XXXX phone bill to prove the calls did not come from my number. Someone fabricated this or spoofed (? is that the term? ) my phone number. 
I have now come to realize that one of the biggest challenges in dealing with an issue at USAA is that there is no ability to communicate seamlessly about an issue with a single person or entity. Every communication begins brand new and as a "" member '', I must completely start at the beginning every single time I call in. I can not reference a "" case number '' or issue id. Furthermore, I have come to understand that the representative 's NOTES concerning the phone calls we have can be completely fabricated. I discovered this today in speaking to the 15th ( + or - a couple ) representative who informed me that he sees a note on my record from the evening of XX/XX/XXXX that reads "" Member called in and claims all charges are valid ''. This is false. I was under the impression that calls were recorded but apparently this is not the case either. I am at the mercy of their "" notes '' that can be written to their benefit or to hide something they have done. 

I have submitted complaints to USAA as well as logged a police report. If identified through the police detective work, I will press charges against the criminals who used a debit card that was linked to my checking account. 

I need consumer protection help because my money was mismanaged by the very bank I trusted to safeguard it. I believe there were internal forces at work here to enable such a well planned gutting of my account.

"REFERENCE CASE NO. XX/XX/XXXX Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, IA XXXX Subject : SLS third -party mortgage loan servicer XX/XX/XXXX To : Whom it may concern, please refer to case numbers. SLS is a third-party collection agency that is unable to supply proof of debt. Initially Specialized Loan Service lied and said, they were the holder of the Note. The fact that SLS lied about who the holder of the Note reflects their knowledge of the fraud. SLS misrepresented themselves as the original lender collecting on behalf of a mortgage debt established in XX/XX/XXXX. After I filed a formal compliant with Cfpb, SLS than sent me a copy of my original Deed of trust ( the one I supplied the court ) with the account number written in pencil at the top. SLS is in breach of a cease and desist that went into effect on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Despite being unable to prove the debt, SLS has attempted to establish ownership of my Deed by paying my paid property taxes in XX/XX/XXXX. I am requesting that SLS request the payment be returned to SLS. I am also requesting that SLS stop harassing me and removes the negative comments, made by them, from my credit report. SLS has not establish or provided any proof they are serving my mortgage. Proof of debt was never provided. I can state with all certainty my Deed is not owned by any investors. I am the holder of the Note. XXXX XXXX failed to record the release of my mortgage in XX/XX/XXXX. SLS is a third- party collection agency acting in the capacity of a mortgage debt collector without proof of debt. I have attached several documents all of which provide and supply evidence supporting my claims made in my federal lawsuit. 
The document titled Independent Foreclosure Review, has been provided to support the claim : XXXX XXXX misrepresented the banks interest in the Plaintiffs property attempting to embezzle the plaintiffs Deed of Trust in XX/XX/XXXX. The Defendant ( XXXX XXXX ) has acknowledged the XX/XX/XXXX slander. The slander was made to try and secure legal conveyance authority, over the Plaintiffs Deed of Trust. The acknowledgement was bolstered upon with the false representation that the fraud was time-barred by the general three-year limitations period. 
The document dated XX/XX/XXXX and subject titled, issue with HUD Partial Claim document ( s ), has been provided to supply evidence to the claim : XXXX XXXX never processed a valid Partial Claims Promissory Note in XX/XX/XXXX, Not on XX/XX/XXXX or on XX/XX/XXXX. Please note the documentation was sent a year after the Defendant ( XXXX XXXX ) is claiming to have executed a Partial Claims Promissory Note and Second Mortgage Loan. Also, I never re-signed or submitted the documents requested. A copy of the unsigned document is attached. The Plaintiff is seeking to quiet her Title after learning her XX/XX/XXXX Partial Claims Note, was not processed by XXXX XXXX and determined to be invalid and render null and void in XXXX by FHA/ HUD . In XX/XX/XXXX the Partial Claims Note was nullified due to XXXX XXXX not having conveyance of the primary mortgage loan. The primary mortgage loan was released by XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. 
The document dated XX/XX/XXXX and titled Notice of transfer of your mortgage, has been provided to supply evidence to the claim : XXXX XXXX attempts to create a legal conveyance instrument, one that would transfer ownership of the Plaintiffs Deed of Trust ultimately, clouded and invalidated the Plaintiffs Deed of Trust. The Plaintiff has been paying on a Note that does not exists. Subsequently, no release could ever have been granted by XXXX XXXX or Specialized Loan Servicing. Please note XXXX XXXX sent a notice in XX/XX/XXXX regarding the transfer of a Partial Claims Promissory Notice that was never processed in XX/XX/XXXX and was nullified by HUD in XX/XX/XXXX. See. Attachment dated XX/XX/XXXX. 

The document dated XX/XX/XXXX and titled Important information about your mortgage account, has been provided to supply evidence to the claim : The Plaintiff was being defrauded and sent contradicting documents that confirmed a conspiracy to commit fraud. The transactions which clouded the Plaintiffs Title to her property were deliberate and made by XXXX XXXX. The documents that XXXX XXXX presented to HUD/FHA were Nullified. No valid Deed or Deed of Trust was established between XXXX XXXX and the Plaintiff.

In a quiet title action, the plaintiff asks the court to declare that he or she has good title to the property in question and compels any adverse claimant to prove a competing ownership claim or forever be barred from asserting it. 65 Am. Jur. 2d Quieting Title 1. In  these actions, the Plaintiff has the burden of showing a title or right superior to that of the defendant as a prima facie case, which means that the plaintiff [ must ] at least prove a title better than that of the defendant, which, if not overcome by the defendant, is sufficient. Jessup, 35 F. Supp. 3d at 36. ( quoting 74 C.J.S. Quieting Title 77 ( 2014 ) ).

"I requested a credit balance check in the month of XX/XX/XXXX. I called US Bank and asked when the check would arrive. I was told, instead, that the bank pushed the payments back to the third-party bill payer, XXXX. I shared my frustration with this action as I would have never requested this option. I called XXXX and they only refunded me four payments totaling, less than {$10000.00}. They gave the reference numbers and I received the return. However, the total return from US Bank was supposed to be {$10000.00}. I called US Bank and my phone call was elevated to a supervisor who created a inquiry about the missing ~ {$700.00} returned payment. A week later I received a letter from the Payment Research Department stating that the refund was completed given a trace number ( XXXX ). I called XXXX and they had no record of such a trace number. I provided them the US Bank altitude card number and saw the refund for the 4 payments that I already received. They clearly stated that there was no other refunded money. They checked the trace number 3 times. I called US Bank again, and again elevated to a supervisor who apologized and elevated the issue. A week later I received another letter from the Payment Research Department, stating the exact same words as the previous letter.

Long story short. I entered into several payment arrangements over the last year to make sure I did not lose my credit card. Here I am thinking everything is getting back on track. They gave me the dates and amounts and I agreed. However when these amounts were given for example if I was only {$150.00} over my limit they would say {$400.00} was owing. I would always pay the arrangement until I was no longer in the red and back to under my credit limit.

"We previously disputed with Citi Business AAdvantage Platinum Select Mastercard a charge for {$130.00} dated XX/XX/2020. The merchant is XXXX  located in XXXX, XXXX. The charge was done on my XXXX ( my wife ) Citi Business card ending in XXXX. Citi did give us a temporary dispute credit, but upon further review of the case ( Case ID : XXXX XXXX ) decided to reverse the temporary credit. This is incorrect because we did not receive benefit from this transaction. We received no service or merchandize from the merchant. 

Here are the details of what happened : My wife, XXXX XXXX, shopped in person at XXXX in XXXX, XXXX on or about XX/XX/2020. She purchased a childs dress for our granddaughter that cost {$29.00}. XXXX attempted to pay with her Citi Business card ending in XXXX but the merchant said that the charge would not go through. So XXXX had the merchant use XXXX XXXX XXXX card ending in XXXX and this charge successfully processed and is correct. Please see the attached document that shows this transaction with XXXX for {$29.00}. 
The childs dress for {$29.00} is the only item that XXXX purchased while shopping at XXXX. XXXX never returned to this merchant on another date and did not authorize any other charges. 
This merchant then processed a second unauthorized charge for {$200.00} dated XX/XX/2020. This one on the XXXX XXXX XXXX card and is the subject of another CFPB compliant ( Complaint ID : XXXX ) with XXXX. We did not receive any benefit for this transaction and then disputed the transaction with XXXX. 
We are unable to reach the merchant. The merchant is located in XXXX, XXXX and we live in XXXX IL USA so we have no way of contacting them. We have tried by email and have been unsuccessful obtaining a response. 

To summarize, XXXX did not authorize the {$130.00} disputed charge of the Citi Business Platinum Select Mastercard. We  did not receive any merchandise or service for this transaction. As explained earlier, the merchant swiped two credit cards on or about XX/XX/2020. First the Citi Business card ending in XXXX that the merchant said did not work, then XXXX XXXX XXXX ending in XXXX. A charge for {$29.00} was processed on the XXXX card that we do not dispute. The merchant somehow stored the card information to fraudulently charge unauthorized charges of {$200.00} on XX/XX/2020 on the XXXX card ending in XXXX, and also {$130.00} on XX/XX/2020 on the Citi Business Mastercard card ending in XXXX. The merchant is dishonest. 
We have purchased thousands of dollars worth of merchandize and services using the Citi Business Platinum Select Mastercard. We rarely dispute transactions and are disappointed that Citi decided to believe the merchant over us. 
We demand that the merchant be held accountable and that the {$130.00} charge be credited to our Citi Business card account promptly. We do not feel safe anymore using our credit cards in foreign countries since the Banks do not want to stand by and protect us from dishonest merchants.

Upon listening to my explanation XXXX had stated that his customer holds the claim that I had resigned from my position and I ensured XXXX that I had email Communications proving otherwise as I responded to a Family Emergency involving my XXXX XXXX infant at the time and that my job was protected by the FMLA Act under such circumstances. 

Therefore, XXXX had agreed to contact his customer as an effort to obtain proof of his customer 's claims in order to validate that his efforts to continue to collect this debt are LEGAL and VALID since, again, I have made it very clear that I did not resign from my position but instead was informed by my former employer, XX/XX/XXXX, in the exact words that "" my employment was not going to be reinstated ''. 

Furthermore, when I requested an explanation from the XXXX recruiter who my telephone inquiry had been forwarded to his response was quote : "" I don't know ''! After requesting further contact as well as the reason for my termination I did not receive any follow up information regarding my termination. I contacted the customer 's legal department and headquarters but no one would forward a response nor explanation. Instead I was referred to the collection agency where I had explained the same terms of the contract prior to making contact with XXXX of the above stated collection agency. 

Upon following up with XXXX after our initial conversation it was determined that he too has failed to follow through on his agreement to provide a reason for my termination nor any proof that his customer 's claims are true. Instead, he became very angered, and resorted to manipulative, abusive tactics without any regard for the message that is being conveyed here while totally disregarding that the continued pursuit to collect this debt is ILLEGAL until the validity of the debt is proven nor is it possible since the customers claims are in fact false and I hold the evidence to prove that I did not resign. 

Therefore, the proof of burden lies upon the Debtor making the request for such claim and to prove the validity of the debt by forwarding proof of my resignation which does not exist at once or accept the final truth that I was in fact terminated which will further validate this dispute against the validity of this debt. If the collection agency can not forward proof of such resignation or reason for termination that occurred without DUE CAUSE then I hereby invalidate the debt once again and proclaim that any further efforts to collect this debt is explicitly ILLEGAL HARASSMENT and must seize to exist! And further request that the collection agency 's customer forward all diploma, certificates, etc. with release of any such claims in the SUBJECT 5 of the Driver employment contract. As upheld by the XXXX XXXX XXXX Supreme Court.",Debt collection,"Lockhart, Morris & Montgomery Inc.",0

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX When I followed up with a phone call about the inaccurate reporting I was told that the letter that I sent was not specific. Really?! I also wrote the credit bureaus during this time period. I got a response back that said File Number XXXX Date Issued : XX/XX/XXXX Pay Status : Account paid in Full ; was a charge off Remarks : PAID IN FULL/WAS CHARGE OFF So ( 1 ) why didn't GM tell the other two bureaus and ( 2 ) why is it now showing as TU - payment after charge off/collection dispute resolved ; reported by grantor. Exp - Account was in dispute- now resolved - reported by subscriber. Unpaid balance reported as a loss by credit grantor. Eq - paid charge off auto. 

Yet all 3 have a {$0.00} balance so what is there to charge off. 
The fact that they initially damaged my score by saying it was a repo was incorrect and should have been removed. Then to state it was actually paid in full to it being back to a chrage off is wrong! You can't charge off a paid account. 

They didn't even acknowledge my request for information so what are they using to validate this debt GMs response said I didn't provide sufficient information and that I needed to provide documents to substantiate the basis of the dispute. Are they kidding?! They are the ones reporting. They are the ones required to validate the debt. 

GM has reported inacurately and continues to do so. I want this account deleted. I hope there is a way to upload what I am saying. Thank you for righting a wrong.",Vehicle loan or lease,"General Motors Financial Company, Inc.",5

"Citi customer service agents have mishandled my account since XX/XX/XXXX. The below summary is what has happened to my account since XX/XX/XXXX to now. 

My actions XX/XX/XXXX I submitted disputed charge of XXXX dollars on the Citi Sears  MasterCard via website. I disputed the charge because I thought I was using a USPS website to do a change of address. Instead it was a fraudulent website and I was charged XXXX dollars. Citi keeps noting XXXX dollars when the credit card statement and all my submitted emails and letter note XXXX dollars. 

Citi actions XX/XX/XXXX Citi sends a postal mailed letter requesting more information about XX/XX/XXXX dispute that was filed. 

My actions XX/XX/XXXX I responded to Citi XX/XX/XXXX letter noting the same information in XX/XX/XXXX email with attachment of he USPS noting I was not using their website. This is when I realized somehow I used a fraudulent website impersonating the USPS from XXXX for online change of address request. 

Citi actions Date unknown Citi stopped my XXXX autopay ( of {$25.00} XXXX I had previous setup years ago sometime between my credit card closing statements of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. BOTH of these statements note YOUR ACCOUNT IS ENROLLED IN AUTOPAY. 

Citi froze my card so it could NOT be used. 

My actions XX/XX/XXXX I tried to use my credit card while shopping and found out it was declined. Very embarrassing. 

Actions between Citi and me XX/XX/XXXX Citi actions I used the Citi online chat to find out why. After a very grueling 1 hour call with a Citi customer service agent I found out that Citi cancelled my XXXX autopay without my permission that was setup previously years prior. Maybe because of the XX/XX/XXXX dispute filed. Because Citi cancelled my XXXX autopay the XXXX bill did not get paid like it normally would on XX/XX/XXXX. Then Citi froze my card. 

XX/XX/XXXX My actions On the above chat I had to reset the autopay back to the XXXX of each month like I did years ago. I had to pay the minimal payment XXXX to clear my card so I could use it. 

XX/XX/XXXX Citi actions Citi sent me a postal mailed letter saying they did not get a full response from me for the XX/XX/XXXX dispute filed. They listed XXXX dollars vs the XXXX dollars listed in my initial request on XX/XX/XXXX and listed on my credit card statement. Citi closed the dispute taking no action because I did not provide sufficient information. In my opinion I did and I sent them a letter via postal mail noting the same. 

XX/XX/XXXX My actions I emailed a complaint to Citi on the website to reopen my dispute case because I was charged by a fraudulent USPS website from XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX Citi actions Citi reopened my dispute initially posted on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Dates unknown Citi actions Citi slashed my credit from XXXX to XXXX sometime between my credit card closing statements of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 

Citi slashed my Cash Advanced Limit from XXXX to XXXX sometime between my credit card closing statements of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 

AND possibly it looks like Citi erased ALL my Thank you points I have earned since starting with this program in XX/XX/XXXX sometime between my credit card closing statements of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. The total points accumulated were XXXX as of XX/XX/XXXX. My account says that You have no eligible promotional balances at this time. I do not know what this means. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX actions I activated my new world credit cards. I use the credit card so I could receive my monthly medications. It was declined for insufficient funds. Very embarrassing again. I could not receive my medications for XXXX. I have no medications right now. 

I called Citi customer service and was on the phone for almost an hour. The Citi agents constantly put me on hold because Citi agents did not how to resolve. Then it was noted that my credit limit was slashed to XXXX. Citi agents could not explain why. This was why my pharmacist received the insufficient funds error. The Citi agents they can not take any further action to resolve. 

XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I emailed two more complaints to Citi via website noting all the above issues that Citi customer service has done to my account and wanted all issues to be resolved so I can use my card like have been before XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX Citi actions Citi replied to my complaints noting I have to call to discuss why the credit limit was slashed. I did that already on XX/XX/XXXX with no reasons. 

On XX/XX/XXXX Citi noted they are reviewing my dispute request for credit of XXXX dollars. On XX/XX/XXXX Citi noted they are unable to resolve my dispute of XXXX dollars and closed the dispute. Again all the paperwork I submitted is XXXX dollars. I feel I have submitted what the required information to receive a XXXX credit. 

Citi denied stopping my XXXX autopayment. Personally I know Citi cancelled my XXXX autopayment because credit card statements note that my account is enrolled in autopay. Also if you look at my payment history it shows autopayments completed on the XXXX of each month for years except for XXXX that Citi stopped. It shows my minimal payment of XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX so I can use my card again. Even my credit card statements say my account is enrolled in autopay and my next statement balance on XX/XX/XXXX is on autopay that I reestablished on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Then Citi noted that my statement with XX/XX/XXXX closing date notes why Citi slashed my credit and cash limits. The statement says I did not pay the bill. In reality Citi cancelled my XXXX autopay which has caused the additional havoc to my account. 

Citi noted they can not restore to credit limit. 

In summary Citi customer service has grossly mishandled my account. I have experienced the following. 

1 Citi supports fraudulent website transactions. Other credit cards companies would have immediately credit customer accounts for charges from fraudulent websites especially charges from companies who impersonate US government agencies. Citi will not credit my account from a fraudulent website. My dispute filed on XX/XX/XXXX is what ultimately started my account being mishandled by Citi customer service. 

2 Without customers not being notified AND not getting customers permission Citi does the following to customer accounts after a dispute is filed. My account shows these Citi actions. 
A Citi stops autopayments and blame customers for not paying their bill. 
B Next Citi freezes credit cards. Later customers find out when they use their card and their cards are denied and can not be used. 
C Customers have to fix their accounts online and reestablish was setup up years prior after Citi inappropriately and without permission changed customer account setup. In this case monthly autopay for the statement balance payments each month was reestablished by customer. 
D In the meantime Citi slashes the credit AND cash limits. Later customers find out when they get denied with insufficient funds. 

3 Finally it looks like Citi wipes out thank you reward points they customers build up over the years. And it looks like Citi took away available promotion points from customers too. 

4 Lastly Citi blames the customers for Citi mishandling of accounts. Customers are left to scramble to figure out how to pay their bills via credit cards that they replied on. Citi made it clear that customers are at fault when it shows in the customers online accounts that Citi agents are at fault. 

What has happened to my account needs to be reported to higher departments with in Citi who handle customer accounts being mishandled by Citi customer service agents. I am requesting this again now. I did the above summary to help with the overview. The resolutions I am asking for my account are. 

Credit XXXX dollars from fraudulent website. Done : Account credited but fraudulent company can recharge within 45 days ( by the end of XX/XX/XXXX ). 
Reestablish credit limit of XXXX. 
Reestablish cash limit of XXXX. 
Reestablish thank you points AND available promotion points that were taken away. As of XX/XX/XXXX it was XXXX points. In XXXX it was approximately XXXX. 
Stop cancelling customers autopay setup without their permission. 
I need my XXXX medications ASAP. I want to use my credit card to show a record of this transaction. I am not able to because my credit limit is too low. Done : Pay this bill by check now.

I also had autopay setup through BoA 's bill pay system, and it autodrafted my previous account balance of {$4400.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. This meant my XX/XX/XXXX BoA statement had a New Balance Total of - {$4300.00} with a Minimum Payment Due of {$0.00} by XX/XX/XXXX. The Important Messages section on Page 4 of the statement clearly says "" You have a credit balance and do not need to make a payment on your account.

They indicated they had no control over the e-bill system and didn't know what had happened. I requested they refund the payment, which they finally did on XX/XX/XXXX. I verified the money was back in my bank account and didn't think anything else needed to be done. On XX/XX/XXXX, I tried to use my BoA card online and it was denied.

At this point I was very upset, so rather than call BoA I used their online chat system. I believe the representative I dealt with was XXXX. She initially said I'd missed a payment, then after 30 minutes of back and forth explaining the situation to her, she credited the {$25.00} missed payment fee, and said she had fixed the account. 

I assumed the issue was taken care of until I tried to use my card online today and it was once again denied. This time I called BoA and had to go through the whole scenario again. The first rep explained that I'd missed a payment in XXXX that was caused by BoA refunding my XXXX payment. I explained my XXXX statement shows there is {$0.00} due so there was no way I could have missed a payment. I finally asked to speak to her supervisor. The supervisor looked at the account, noted that the {$25.00} had been credited on XX/XX/XXXX, but then said I should have made a minimum payment in XXXX and that there was nothing she could do about it other than take a payment today.

"COMPLAINTOver the 16 years that I have had the CITI/Mastercard/Shell card, CITI/Mastercard/Shell has arbitrarily suspended the use of the card claiming suspicious transactions several times. Up to today (XX/XX/2019), there has NEVER been a fraudulent transaction on the card. However, the arbitrary security suspensions continue on a regular basis on the flimsiest of reasons. And while in each card suspension I suspected racial discrimination motives I just let it go, that is, until this last security suspension because this last suspension goes beyond the pale and I have decided to make it known that, in my personal opinion and experience, CITI/Mastercard/Shell actively engages either in racial discriminatory actions and/or CITI/Mastercard/Shell engages in restraint of trade actions and/or CITI/Mastercard/Shell engages in neighborhood redlining, and/or CITI/Mastercard/Shell engages in all of these actions.FACTSOn Monday XX/XX/2019 I found in my home landline phone the sop message from CITI to the effect that my CITI/Mastercard/Shell card was suspended because of suspicious transactions using the CITI/Mastercard/Shell card the previous day, Sunday XX/XX/2019.I called the CITI/Mastercard/Shell customer service number listed on the card and I was informed that the card was suspended due to 3 suspicious events. Those 3 suspicious events were: First, that the CITI/Mastercard/Shell card had been used to make a $XXXX   gasoline purchase in XXXX Texas; Second, that the CITI/Mastercard/Shell card gasoline purchase was at a XXXX, Texas XXXX gas station and that I had never purchase gasoline from a XXXX  gas station; Third, that the CITI/Mastercard/Shell card also had been used again that day to make another purchase of $XXXX   gasoline at a Shell gas station in XXXX XXXX, Texas. Even after assuring the phone rep that, First I indeed had made the purchases and Second, that indeed the charges were legitimate, I still had to assure and re-assure the phone operator that I did have the card in my physical possession.BACKGROUNDAccording to the CITI/Mastercard/Shell customer representative I had never used the card in XXXX, that I had never used the car to buy gasoline from XXXX, and that it was unusual that I purchased gasoline twice in the same day. These justifications are so preposterous as to be laughable if it were not for the prejudicial and discriminatory motives behind the card suspension.My residence is in XXXX XXXX TX, a suburb of XXXX TX. The island of XXXX TX is a State of Texas and USA famous resort and historic area, within less than 1 hour drive from my home,  that I visit very frequently and the proposition that I have never used the CITI/Mastercard/Shell card in XXXX during the last 16 years is simply preposterous. But even if it were true, since when using a credit card in XXXX TX is a criminal suspicion activity?I use the CITI/Mastercard/Shell card preferentially, but not exclusively, to purchase gasoline, mostly at Shell gas stations, but over the years I probably have used the car at all major type of gas stations all over the country. The CITI/Mastercard/Shell customer representative could not explain that the problem was. Was the problem because it was a XXXX gas station, a Shell competitor? Or was the problem was that the XXXX gas station was located in an economically poor, racially mixed XXXX/XXXX neighborhood? For sure in these 16 years CITI/Mastercard/Shell has never had any problems when I have used the card to make purchases, any kind of purchases, at any time of day or night, at any day of the week, at any time of the year, at any location, for any amount, in an economically affluent middle/upper class XXXX neighborhood even when I had never been there before in my life.The most brazen assertion by CITI/Mastercard/Shell was that I had purchased gasoline twice in the same day. My family owns and operates on a daily basis several gasoline powered cars. We usually fill the cars on weekends in preparation to use the cars during the workweek. Because I gas the cars, and I can only drive one car at a time I usually split the car fueling over the weekend. During the last 16 years of this routine it is not unusual at all that I might have to fill-up more than one car, over consecutive days, or on the same day during the weekend. This justification by CITI/Mastercard/Shell is an insulting canard attempt to put a cover to conceal the real reason for the suspension, that in my concept, either/or racially discriminates me, either/or redlines the neighborhood where I made the purchase, either/or attempts to discourage the use of XXXX   gasoline, either/or all of those reasons.RELEVANT EVENTDuring the 16 years that I have used the CITI/Mastercard/Shell card there has NEVER been a fraudulent charge on the card. But the card has been security suspended for the flimsiest, and in my personal opinion, racial prejudicial of reasons.On the preceding Monday (XX/XX/2019) leading to the weekend where the events of this complaint took place, I had a contractor install a new garage door opener in my house and I asked the contractor to charge the cost to the CITI/Mastercard/Shell card. In the process of entering the card information into his portable terminal, the contractor mistyped a value [in flipping the card the wrong way, it read XXXX for XXXX], and made a couple of attempts to make the charges go through but the transactions were justifiable denied. The next day, Tuesday XX/XX/2019 I called CITI/Mastercard/Shell customer service, explained and the situation, the card was re-activated, and the contractor was able to complete the transaction.I document this particular transaction because during the 16 years that I have used the CITI/Mastercard/Shell card this is the ONLY time, ever, that there has been a valid issue with any transaction that could be considered suspicious, and I took the time to contact CITI/Mastercard/Shell.",Credit card or prepaid card,"CITIBANK, N.A.",1

"I opened a new Amex Aspire credit card via a friends referral. He recommended the card which comes with an attractive welcome bonus : spending {$4000.00} in the first 3 months upon receiving the card, the customer can earn XXXX XXXX XXXX points. I traveled a lot and XXXX is one of my favorite hotels, and this welcome bonus of XXXX XXXX points is the main driver for me to choose this card among many other choices. 

At the beginning everything seems smooth. On XX/XX/XXXX I applied the card online with my friends referral code, and my application was approved promptly. There was no warning sign, non pop-up window to state I am not eligible for the welcome bonus in any way. Instead, the application web page displayed the welcome bonus during the steps of application, making me feel reassured. 

In the next two months I pooled my spending together to this new card, and meet the {$4000.00} spending line within XX/XX/XXXX. Eagerly waited for several weeks, I was disappointed to see the bonus points was not deposit into my account. And so I contacted Amex customer service by web page messaging on XX/XX/XXXX, to ask whether I am eligible for the welcome bonus and did I meet the spending threshold. I got positive answers for both questions. Please see snapshots # 1 and # 2, where the Amex agent answered Happy to check that your qualified spend is already met. And I was told I can wait for more time for the welcome bonus coming. 

However it just did not come after more waiting. I was planning for a spring travel and without the XXXX points expected to come, I need to pay out of my pocket, which is very disturbing to my financial plan. And so I checked again with Amex web page messages. Very surprisingly, this time another Amex agent told me I did NOT get approved for the welcome offer, and the previous chat on XX/XX/XXXX seems to be some miscommunication regarding the declined offer.

On XX/XX//2019, I requested for my annual free credit report via annual free credit report online to view the medical collections placed against me. I contacted the collection agency, Online Information Services at XXXX as indicated on my credit report. I inquired what the medical debt was about, location of the medical service ( s ) rendered, name of the clinic or hospital, date ( s ) of service ( s ), etc. Before providing answers to my questions, the collection agency representative asked me  several questions to verify my identity. After verifying my identity, she answered my aforementioned questions. I informed her that the individual used my identity, but it wasn't me. I informed her that I was not near XXXX XXXX, Missouri nor do I reside there. I continued to inform her that for any medical services, I have always been seen at a VA hospital near my residence.

"I inherited my home 3 years ago and have been paying the mortgage every month on time to Wells Fargo Mortgage ever since I became the beneficiary. I was also appointed as the executor and trustee of my partners last will and testament. During the 3 years after I inherited the home the decision my partner made for me to be the sole beneficiary was unchallenged and supported by everyone in his family. Initially after my partner passed it was difficult for me to go through the formality and process with the mortgage company to assume the loan, because it gave me comfort to see his name on the mortgage since I always considered it to be our home. If I would have gone through the process with the mortgage company to assume the loan my partners name would have replaced with my name as the borrower. With that being the case I also had my perso nal battle with XXXX making the fight for my life the priority over assuming the loan. 

After three years of making on time loan payments to Wells Fargo Mortgage I was faced with some major home repair issues. Being on a fixed income and receiving XXXX as my only income source, has made my budget very tight and I never had the luxury of building a savings. Unfortunately in XX/XX/2019 I had to make the decision to use my house payment money to fund an emergency repair. Being behind one house payment created a ripple effect, and I began accumulating an arearage, making it more difficult to become current on my mortgage. To date I've, never been able to close the gap on the mortgage arrears. My time in loan default grew to 90 days as of XX/XX/XXXX, and triggered Wells Fargo to begin the foreclosure process. I've been trying to work with Wells Fargo to remediate foreclosure and have had nothing but a host of challenges and obstacles, creating a barrier to avoid foreclosure with Wells Fargo only offering me limited information and no options other than reinstatement to become current on the loan. 

I've been trying to find out since mid XXXX how the foreclosure of my home went from being 90 days in default as of XX/XX/2019, past pre-foreclosure, and currently in active foreclosure, queued for a sale date as of XX/XX/XXXX. Since beginning my effort to assume the Mortgage in early XXXX, no one will explain how Wells Fargo expeditiously put my home on the fast track to foreclosure. It took several passes to even obtain minimal information about the loan since my partner is still named the primary borrower. Since early XXXX, Wells Fargo has limited my contact to first work with the life events team to add me as an interested party obtaining only limited information about the loan. They make the option to go through the process for a loan modification completely off limits. Every phone call I've made I've asked Wells Fargo to provide me with a temporary protection from foreclosure while I work with them to assume the loan, they refuse to give me foreclosure protection and they continue making me wait in a holding pattern while they're working in the background with all their red tape and newly mentioned processes every phone call with a new single point of contact that never answers the phone when you dial their direct extension, someone else answers with new information and never any next steps to help me meet the simple step to assume the loan. After keeping me in a holding pattern for weeks while their foreclosure department is actively in the process of completing the foreclosure of my home and in final steps to schedule a sale date. Working with Wells Fargo team members who make it seem like it's too late for me to do anything to avoid foreclosure that is going at the speed of light. I finally avoided the aggravation of taking backward steps because they are demanding three years after my partners passing that his last will and testament go through the probate process to avoid anyone stepping up as a beneficiary with reinstatement as my only option go avoid foreclosure. New single point of contacts are calling me to request additional documents after telling these people countless times my partners last will and testament is the only document I have, which they received a copy of two weeks ago, these new Wells Fargo contacts leave messages requesting additional documents because the will I provided that remains uncontested is referred to as a partial non probated will. I've fought the battle explaining to every paper pusher I get put in contact with, I have to remind them not all wills go through probate and is a legal document. I'm not a legal genius but how can they refuse it as a legal will and testament and not be obligated to recognize me as a legal heir and legally placed as the borrower. Today was the final straw that I hope will be considered unacceptable and proves Wells Fargo does bad business and forces people into foreclosure. These people are ignoring regulatory requirements and scampering around to finish the foreclosure of my home that was placed on a fast track because they already knew my partner was deceased, and I took them by complete 7surprise by stepping up to assume the mortgage, which is ordinarily a rubber stamp process. They continue to make it impossible for me to assume the mortgage. Finally when I barged in and made the foreclosure department speak to me because I threatened them and told them I have submitted a formal complaint with you. The first mention that a complaint was submitted to the CFPB, they demanded the case number and immediately directed me to submit my complaint to Wells Fargo executive complaint department. I refused because the CFPB will ensure Wells Fargo operates in compliance. I threw them a curve ball and told them I was holding off on my complaint to you. They told me I had the option to reinstate with a new twist of paying closing costs and some other fee that sounded ridiculous. When I told them that sounded suspicious and completely made up, l they gave me another only option j my other only option was to apply and be qualified for a new mortgage loan. When I asked why they weren't giving me the option to assume the loan They offered to put me in contact with the assumption department to see if I qualified to assume the loan. I played dumb because I wanted to hear how they were going to refuse to recognize me as the legal heir and successor to assume the loan. I was put in contact with a woman whose name is XXXX XXXX. I asked XXXX what will it take to assume the loan she immediately responded with a denial for me to assume the loan because it was in foreclosure. I asked XXXX how can I avoid foreclosure she continued to state that I didn't qualify because I'm not vetted as a person associated with the mortgage. I told XXXX she was making a bad decision she held her ground and I told her she was forcing me into foreclosure and that it was bad business she denied saying that. I'm really counting on someone from the CFPB contact Wells Fargo to find out what they are doing because they are scampering around and keeping me at bay while they fast track the forecloure of my home and continuing to make new excuses and denying me my rights as the legal heir and beneficiary making me the homeowner.

"I applied on a refinance mortgage loan with my existing mortgage bank J.G Wentworth - to eliminate the PMI cost. All the process was done online. My current loan had an escrow statement balance of {$3700.00} the homeowner insurance was paid for the entire year. During the closing process I asked several times if the escrow balance on my existing mortgage loan was going to be returned and when. They told each time that that was going to be returned to me after the current loan was paid off. So I proceed with the closing process, they send the closing disclosure and details. it showed the loan paid off amount of {$370.00}, the new loan amount and all the closing costs detailed. In the new escrow estimates included my 2019 tax payment amount and homeowner insurance reserve for 8 months. So all the numbers make sense, once again I asked to my loan processor and underwriter to confirm that the escrow balance on the old mortgage loan was going to be returned in full, they said. They also asked me to reach out to the customer service department for my existing loan, which I did. I also asked for the pay off amount to confirm the that the numbers shown on the Loan Disclosure, and the numbers matched. On XXXX XXXX we closed. Twenty days after the closing I contacted J.G. Wentworth and asked where was my money for my old escrow account, each time they refused to provide the amount, and they told it will sent after the apply the wire transfer and show the account Paid. After a month and half of waiting, I received a check for {$490.00} dollars. I immediately contacted them, spoke with a few supervisors and each time I was given a different story. One said that they had a note on the account that the customer requested the escrow to be netted to the payoff. I asked for a proof of that, they gave me the run around, once again. I told them that I had copies of all documents I signed, and I was NEVER asked if that was something I wanted to do. what makes me more upset is that I NEVER requested or signed any documents that indicated for my escrow to be netted with the payoff amount. I reminder that if they looked at the account notes, I called several times before the closing to asked on how long would take to get the money for the escrow balance. My other argument was that if they netted the escrow to the payoff amount, why my payoff amount didn't decrease? it was the same amount they provide all along and that this was never disclosed on the loan documents. I also reached out to the loan processor and adjuster ( keep in mind that this is the same mortgage company ). He said that they ( J.G Wentworth ) provided them with the payoff amount. the other said of J.G. Wentworth claims that they ( J.G Wentworth -- New loans ) asked to net the escrow with the payoff amount. During the closing process - No where in the documents indicated that J.G Wentworth "" decided '' to net my escrow with the payoff amount without really crediting the {$3700.00} that I had or the {$3200.00} they took from my escrow account. Two weeks later they send me a letter that my account was sold to XXXX XXXX. 

I have purchased XXXX homes in my lifetime dealt with mortgage lenders but never in my life dealt with such dishonest bank. In addition to lied to a customer, they provided incorrect loan disclosure to keep money that didn't belong to them. if my payoff amount was {$370000.00} and that was what all the statements and documents had. what did they did with my {$3200.00}. they even charged interests for days that the loan was already they received a transfer amount and it took them a month to showed that the loan was "" Paid '' I'm sure I'm not the first nor the last person that this dishonest bank stole from.

"On XX/XX/XXXX HSBC bank at the behest of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has completely frozen my account. According to The Exempt Income Protection Act of 2009 If any funds are restrained, the bank, within two business days after receipt of the restraining notice or execution, exemption notice and exemption claim forms, must serve upon the account holder the exemption notice and two exemption claim forms by first class mail to the account holders last known address. The exemption notice explains to the account holder that the account has been restrained, that certain types of funds are exempt and the procedures for releasing an account, including the types of documents that will be helpful in demonstrating the existence of statutorily exempt funds. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX such documentation has not been provided to me. 

More importantly the first {$XXXX} in an account can not be frozen. 

The new law creates a {$XXXX} cushion for debtors who don't receive government benefits or assistance. In particular, the law prohibits banks from executing, levying, attaching, garnishing, encumbering or restraining an amount equal to or less than 240 times the federal or state minimum wage, which ever is greater, except to the extent a court determines is not necessary for the reasonable requirements of the judgment debtor and his or her dependents. The amount of this exemption is currently {$XXXX} but is scheduled to rise to {$XXXX} on XX/XX/XXXX and in accordance with the minimum wage thereafter. 

If a restraint was placed illegally it can not be enforced. 

Banks may not charge the account holder a fee if it is served with a restraining notice and the bank account can not be lawfully restrained OR IF THE RESTRAINT IS PLACED ON THE ACCOUNT IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW.

"I applied for a loan with Guaranteed Rate on XX/XX/2019. I received my pre-approval on XX/XX/2019. I submitted an offer on the house on XX/XX/2019, which was accepted. We set a closing date for XX/XX/2019, which I was assured would be no problem by my mortgage specialist, XXXX XXXX. As the closing date came closer, the whole process with Guaranteed Rate became a nightmare. The original closing date came and went, and I was told almost every day that it would just be another day or two, however, I wasnt actually able to close until XX/XX/2019. 

Due to all the delays, directly caused by Guaranteed rate, I was promised a total of {$3500.00} in lender credits to ease the suffering I endured during this process at the hands of XXXX XXXX and his team at Guaranteed Rate. Before this home purchase, I was renting a house that the owners sold, and my wife and I had to be out of the house on XX/XX/2019 ( 18 days after the original closing date ). Because we couldnt close on time, my wife and I were homeless from XX/XX/2019 until XX/XX/2019. At this point I had been promised {$2000.00} in lender credits because of delays caused by Guaranteed Rate, but XXXX XXXX promised me another {$1500.00} ( bringing the total to the previously mentioned {$3500.00} ) to help us with expenses incurred from being homeless for the weekend. 

On XX/XX/2019, XXXX XXXX from Guaranteed Rate sent over a closing disclosure, showing my cash to close estimated at {$6500.00}. When I arrived at the title company on XX/XX/2019, Guaranteed Rate sent over another disclosure showing cash to close at around $ XXXX. I had stated I was putting $ XXXX down, I was receiving an $ XXXX credit from the seller, and then also the {$3500.00} lender credit from Guaranteed Rate. Prior to closing I had provided the seller with $ XXXX in earnest money. 

I had brought with me a cashiers check for {$7500.00} which should have been more than enough to cover the closing as previously described by Guaranteed Rate. However, when we went to process the paperwork, Guaranteed Rate then sent over another disclosure, which then stated that I needed over $ XXXX to close. 

This was due to the fact that the seller credit completely covered all the closing costs and I was told by Guaranteed Rate that they were taking away the {$3500.00} credit they promised me for my pain and suffering through the loan process. I was told that they had nothing they could apply the lender credit to, and so I had to lose that money. This was my first time buying a house and I was never informed by Guaranteed Rate prior to closing that the credit could not be used toward a down payment. In fact, they sent me multiple closing disclosures that show the {$3500.00} lender credit decreasing the amount I owed for my down payment. 

They put me in a position where I was forced to close on the loan, otherwise my wife and I would be homeless. XXXX XXXX and his team knew the entire time that they couldnt give me the lender credit they promised me, and they kept increasing the amount of the credit several times to keep me happy, knowing I would never see any of that money.

"I sent a message to my loan servicer, Mr Cooper. In my message I asked them to waive an old late fee on my account that was invalid. I asked them to waive it because I was trying to pay my mortgage ahead 4 months but that late fee was preventing me from doing it. I sent them that message in XXXX. They proceeded to put me on a forbearance plan that I never asked for did nor did I need. I did NOT lose my job during the virus crisis. I was perfectly capable of making my payments and in fact was trying to pay ahead 4 months. When they put me on the forbearance I emailed and called them three times and told them to remove me off of the forbearance plan because I didn't need it and didn't want it. To this day, they still have not removed me. It's incredibly disheartening. 

I want to be removed off of the forbearance plan and I have tried numerous times tell them to remove me but they have yet to do so. I never signed any agreement to be on a forbearance nor did I ever asked to be on the plan. I understand that some people needed it because they lost their jobs but why would you force somebody on a forbearance who has a job and is able to make their payments?

812. Furnishing certain deceptive forms [ 15 USC 1692j ] ( a ) It is unlawful to design, compile, and furnish any form knowing that such form would be used to create the false belief in a consumer that a person other than the creditor of such consumer is participating in the collection of or in an attempt to collect a debt such consumer allegedly owes such creditor, when in fact such person is not so participating. ( b ) Any person who violates this section shall be liable to the same extent and in the same manner as a debt collector is liable under section 813 for failure to comply with a provision of this title.

The FCRA requires that debt collectors give any documents related to an account that is requested Please send me copies of all records relating to the account, including : date account open all sign original contract Account applications made on paper, online, or by telephone Account statements or invoices Records of payment or charge slips Delivery addresses associated with the account Records of phone numbers used to activate or access the account Signatures on applications and accounts Investigators report This is NOT a request for verification or proof of my mailing address, but a request for VALIDATION made pursuant to the above named Title and Section. I respectfully request that your offices provide me with competent evidence that I have any legal obligation to pay you. 

Please provide me with the following : What the money you say I owe is for : Explain and show me how you calculated what you say I owe : Provide me with copies of any papers that show I agreed to pay what you say I owe : Provide a verification or copy of any judgment if applicable : Identify the original creditor : Prove the Statute of Limitations has not expired on this account : Show me the you are licensed to collect in my state : Provide me with your license numbers and Registered Agent or Agent of Service : At this time I will also inform that if offices have reported invalidated information to any of the 3 major Credit Bureaus { XXXX, XXXX or XXXX } this action might constitute fraud under both Federal and State Laws. Due to this fact, if any negative mark is found on any of my credit reports by theses companies, I will not hesitate to bring legal action against you for the following : Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act Defamation of Character If your offices are able to provide proper documentation as requested in the following Declaration, I will require at least 30 days to investigate this information and during such time all collection activity must cease and desist. 

Since youve obviously neglected to investigate this account thoroughly I am demanding you remove this account off my profile. It is at this time that I will point out the in Cushman v TransUnion, Stevenson v. TRW ( Experian ), and Richardson v. Fleet, Equifax et, the courts ruled each and every time that the CRA couldnt merely Parrot information from the creditors and collection agencies that they have conduct an independent REASONABLE investigation to ensure the validity of the debt and honesty/integrity of the creditors/CA in question. Sending out a generic form through the XXXX system that doesnt even contain my reasons for the dispute is not reasonable. 


Which Im sure you are aware each violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act allows damages of {$1000.00} should this matter ends up in court. 
I look forward to an expedite resolution of this matter Thank you. 


Also, during this validation period, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of my credit reports, I will consult with my legal counsel for suit. This includes listing any information with a credit reporting repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated or verifying an account as accurate, when it fact there is no provided proof that it is accurate. 

If your company fails to respond to this validation request within 30 days from the date of your receipt, all references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from my credit report and a copy of such deletion { to any/all of the 3 major credit reporting bureaus : XXXX, XXXX  and XXXX } request shall be sent to me immediately. 

I would also like to request, in writing, that no telephone contact be made by your company to my home or my place of employment. If your offices attempt telephone communication with me, including but not limited to computer generated calls and calls or correspondence sent to or with any third parties, it will be considered harassment and I will have no choice but to file suit. All future communications with me MUST be done in writing and sent to the address noted in this letter by USPS. 

It would be advisable that you assure your records are in order before I am forced to take legal action against your company and your client. This is an attempt to correct your records, any information obtained shall be used for that purpose.

I stated that I was very surprised and because I have from XXXX XXXX to make my payment. First she said well your payment was due XX/XX/XXXX in a stern tone. Again I asserted that it was my right to pay within the first 2 weeks of the month without harrassment. And then She said she was in the internal collections department at Flagstar and wanted to reassure methat this matter had not gone beyond the bank??! 

I stated that I scheduled my payment for XX/XX/XXXX. 

She then asked why I was paying "" late '' ... what was the reason and did I intend to continue paying this way each month, which I found incredibly intrusive. 

I assured her that I understood the banks were in a tight spot but that I was gainfully employed if that's what she wanted to know.

"Dear Consumers Financial Protection Bureau I have an issue that I have been trying to resolve since late XXXX of this year. I made several orders on a website called XXXX, which sells gift cards. I purchased 3 XXXX gift cards from them in the form of two separate orders. The first order was made on XX/XX/XXXX, it consisted of two gift cards, one that valued at {$110.00} and the other valued at {$130.00}. When I received them, the two gift cards has {$0.00} in both. On XX/XX/XXXX I had purchased the 3rd gift card that valued at {$72.00}, but the card only had {$11.00} upon being received. On XX/XX/XXXX, I emailed XXXX customer service and informed them of the problem with the gift cards. I had gotten no response back within the day, thus I proceeded to call their customer service number but there was no answer. Within a week I still had no response from XXXX, so I contacted my bank, Bank of America which is the credit card I used to purchase the gift cards. I informed them about the situation with XXXX and they redeposited the {$320.00} used to purchase the gift cards back into my bank account and told me they would investigate the situation with XXXX. 
I finally received a reply to my email on XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX stating they would help me by contacting XXXX support about the gift cards and call me back when they received an answer. After that I did not get any responses from them. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I saw that the {$320.00} was taken out of my Bank of America account. I called Bank of America credit card to ask them why that was, they informed me that during their investigation they could not get into contact with XXXX and needed evidence sent to them about all our inquiries with XXXX. I sent them the emails and replies that I had with XXXX customer service. I was awaiting for Bank of America to continue the investigation and get back to me. I went out of town and came back around XX/XX/XXXX and got a letter from Bank of America, that was dated XX/XX/XXXX when they sent it, informing me I needed to send in documentation proving I was scammed by XXXX by XX/XX/XXXX. The time frame in which I was allowed to do this task was limited to 8 days, but the mail was sent out during the time I was out of town. I call Bank of America credit card to inform them immediately that I was out of town and to request that they allow time to continue investigating my case. They told me I needed to get into contact with XXXX again and that they would open a new case for me. I tried my best to email and call XXXX again to ask them to process me a return as the gift cards were empty or missing the proper amount, that was on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Bank of America sent me another letter on XX/XX/XXXX to inform me that my new case has been closed again due to lack of evidence provided to them. I called Bank of America again to inform them that I emailed XXXX, but the customer service provider was very rude and denied to keep my case open as it passed the time frame they gave us. 
XXXX did not email me back until XX/XX/XXXX, telling me that based on their website policies, they would not issue refunds or replacements after 45 days since purchase. However, I had emailed them before, but they never resolved my issue and waited until the time limit had passed to let me know I cant even get a refund. 
I emailed XXXX back to inform them that they were mistaken as I had emailed them as soon as I received my purchase and found that they were defective and I could not even use them. Since that email they have not responded to me at all, which has occurred throughout this situation. They take forever to reply to my emails and they have a customer service number : XXXX, which they never answered when I called during their business hours. 
I have been scammed by XXXX and my Bank of America credit card has refused to continue to help me investigate this situation through.

At that point I said I do not consent to being recorded, at which point they ended the call. 

I then called them back and asked for their company name, they said it was "" TransWorld ''. I explained that I just got a call from them asking about my sister, reiterating to them that she is a minor. I asked why they were trying to contact her, they said they could only talk to a legal guardian, and strongly implied it was my mother they are really trying to get in touch with. I asked them directly if they were a debt collector, they lied and said they were not. I told them it was unacceptable for them to be calling me about my sister like this, they quickly said they would remove my number and ended the call. 

I then looked up TransWorld, confirmed they are in fact a debt collector and called them one more time to confirm why they lied to me and ask why they are calling me about my sister, who again is a minor. The woman who answered this time denied any knowledge of it, I reminded her that they say at the beginning of the calls that they are recording and demanded that they stop calling me, stop harassing my family, and they are to never drag my sister into this again.

We also know why they, Veterans United Home Loans, are contacting us now is because we did try and refinance our VA loan with horrible experiences from four different lenders this past month. Our experience was that the lenders would basically get our home equity in either closing or points costs to us for just a difference of $ 100-200 in our monthly payment. We felt that we would gain better by paying extra towards our principal balance each month to lower the amount of interest we would pay over the time of the loan.

I decided to call HomeloanServ to figure out why there was such a large surplus, and they said not to worry about it this happens all the time. I made them aware this was a new build home so the taxes will go up XXXX year so I don't think they have this worked out correctly, they basically ignore my concerns. I decided to check my property taxes with the county and notice there was two mortgage companies paying my property tax - HomeLoanServ./ Idaho Housing and XXXX XXXX.

"I recently consolidated delinquent loans while finishing graduate school and attempt to get things back in order upon graduation. On XXXX my application process begins for consolidation with Fed Loan Servicing in the amount of {$27000.00} to which on XXXX, a payment is made to the US. Dept. of Education. During this time, Fed Loan Serving requests the amount due on the loans I submitted for consolidation and makes a payment electronically to the US. Dept. of Education. At this time, I receive a notice for the successful  consolidation. Also, my loans are in deferment while I finish school in XXXX. Fast forward to XXXX, for which I receive a letter from the US. Department of Education informing me that an underpayment had occurred in the consolidation payoff ( approx 6 months after the fact ) in the total amount of {$2100.00} across 3 loans. When I call about these loans, I am told that they are being serviced by Fed Loan but what I can't get a straight answer on between the Dept of Education and Fed Loan is who exactly has the account. 

A few days later, on XXXX there is a delinquent account reported on my credit report as a charge off in the amount of {$710.00} that causes my credit score to drop. In addition, on the report it says the account was closed on XXXX. Next, on XXXX Fed Loan Servicing makes an additional payment to cover the underpayment. The peculiar thing about this is that I call both agencies on XXXX to figure out how this amount was reported on my credit without knowledge of the a balance being due prior to a week before. I call the US Dept. of Education to dispute the delinquent account reported on my credit for which they can not tell me where the obscure amount of {$710.00} is from or which loan it is. I am informed by a representative there that they received the payment in XXXX and then sent a notice of underpayment to Fed Loan Servicing on XXXX. At this point, I can not wrap my head around it taking over 5 months for this discrepancy to be resolved. I asked why I was not informed of the underpayment and was told that this was handled between the agencies through the "" Back Office ''. So I request the documentation of the letter or form so that I can call Fed Loan and dispute the timeliness of the underpayment request, but I am told that they are not able to provide the documentation to me regarding MY ACCOUNT and that I would have to write a letter requesting the information. Oh and I had to speak with two representatives, both of which I was disconnected in the middle of disputing this information request. 

Next I call Fed Loan Servicing right after that ( still on XXXX ) trying to get to the bottom of this and figure out how this account was reported to the credit bureau and where it came from. So I explain the situation to the representative and I get a similar feeling as the representative just keeps saying that he can't find anything noted on the account. I get transferred to a "" supervisor '' and plead my case in trying to figure this out. She tells me a similar response as the representative at the Dept. of Education, in that the information regarding the transactions between Fed Loan Servicing and the Dept. of Education are done "" behind the scenes '' and the information is ""  confidential '' and I am unable to see it. I have read my borrower 's rights and I can not find a single instance or phrasing with the ability to deny me information regarding my accounts.

In XX/XX/XXXX, I filed Ch. XXXX Bankruptcy in Missouri.  The bankruptcy was discharged in XX/XX/XXXX.  My bankruptcy case number is XXXX.  Sallie Mae continued to report on my credit report the debt was owed and my bankruptcy attorney sent them a letter stating the debt does not qualify as a ""student loan"" and it was discharged with the bankruptcy.  My attorney stated in the letter that Sallie Mae was violating federal bankruptcy law and any questions or contacts relating to this debt should be made to him, my attorney.  Sallie Mae has acknowledged receipt of this letter from my attorney.

I hadn't heard from Sallie Mae since my attorney sent that letter until recently.  There was a pending class action law suit over this exact matter in the XXXX Circuit Court of Appeals.  The XXXX Circuit recently decided in In re: XXXX XXXX XXXX, case No. XXXX that XXXX XXXX loans are dischargeable in chapter XXXX bankruptcy.

I stated that I do not owe this debt, it was discharged with my bankruptcy in XX/XX/XXXX.  I included a copy of the letter sent by my attorney with this letter sent by myself.  I also included proof of the discharged bankruptcy, stating I do not owe Sallie Mae any money.  This letter was received by Sallie Mae on XX/XX/XXXX.

Since that time, the communications to me have slowed down but not ceased.  Sallie Mae has left me multiple voicemails after receiving this communication from me.  The letter was mailed from my home, with a computer printed return address label for my current residence.  On XX/XX/XXXX, Sallie Mae faxed two requests to my employer requesting my information.

"Recently, I noticed several fraudulent charges totaling {$3000.00} to my account. The fraud was reported over the phone as soon as I noticed it, on XX/XX/XXXX. Bank of America issued a temporary credit and opened an investigation. However, my claim was denied in a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, which I received and opened on XX/XX/XXXX. There was almost no reasoning or information in the letter. The key phrase denying the claim is : Based on your account history, this charge is consistent with previous charges with this merchant. 

This raises more questions than it answers. With 13 fraudulent transactions spread over 9 merchants ( listed below ), why is the letter using the singular for merchant? Does Bank of America really believe Im paying multiple utility bills in areas I have no presence? XXXX and XXXX are both utilities. Ive never heard of XXXX before, and I believe XXXX services the XXXX area.

While I can not tell what the other transaction ( reference number XXXX ) is for, I am certain neither my wife the only other authorized user -- nor I made this transaction. 

I could go on, but it suffices to say that after they denied my claim I can not trust Bank of America to prevent fraud or deal with it responsibly. I paid off the balance of valid transactions and closed my accounts on XX/XX/XXXX. 

When I first reported the fraud on XX/XX/XXXX, the phone agent indicated that this was probably because a data breach, and that he had been seeing a lot of similar activity. In fact, Bank of America had already indicated to me over email on XX/XX/XXXX that they were sending me a new card because of a data breach.

I show no missed calls in my phones log, or in my phone company records. To be frank, that is XXXX word against two pieces of evidence that I have no reason to doubt. I do not believe Bank of America attempted to call me, and I do not believe Bank of America has acted in good faith to deny my fraud claim. 

While on the phone with XXXX, I noticed and reported two more transactions with XXXX  XXXX. I dont know how or why these were approved, since I was told they were blacklisted in my initial XX/XX/XXXX call. I also dont know why one of these transactions is for a negative amount.

I was referred to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX by one of XXXX XXXX XXXX. We met at a XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, NY on XX/XX/2019. 

XXXX XXXX glanced over our tax returns, pay stubs, bank statements, w-2 's, etc. He immediately, verbally, approved us for around XXXX without putting any information/ figures into his computer. 

He stated he would send out our pre-qualification letter next day. He then told us what differentiated him from other big lenders was the ability to waive ALL fee 's associated with closing cost except state fee 's and taxes. 

After a few months of house shopping we finally found the one. On XX/XX/2019 we met with our attorney and received an estimated closing cost of {$27000.00}. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we were in contract and reached out to XXXX to begin the mortgage process. We sent out all requested documentation. On XX/XX/2019 we received a closing cost worksheet, from XXXX, around {$27000.00} as we expected. 

Through out the two months our mortgage was being worked on, XXXX disappeared. We were left in the dark. We were expecting a walk through during this whole mortgage process with updates as needed. We were consistently writing emails and texting to find out what was going on. It was very difficult to get a response and if we did, it was a one word answer. 

Around mid XXXX we spoke with XXXX again double checking our closing cost fee 's. He reassured us it would definitely be a lot less than the {$27000.00}. 

Now it's XX/XX/XXXX and we receive an email from XXXX about origination fee 's costing 1.529 % and we are locked at a rate of 4 %. We are due to close the XXXX of XXXX. 

Our closing cost fee jumped from {$27000.00} to {$39000.00}. {$12000.00} more than we anticipated. This was very alarming. We referred back to our commitment letter and the origination fee to Freedom Mortgage was only {$1200.00}. This was a very distressing experience as first time home buyers. 

It was never explained to us what locking a rate meant and when it was a best time to do so. It was never explained to us we would incur a {$10000.00} origination loan fee nine days before our closing date. 

I feel XXXX had an moral obligation to disclose all fee 's up front. He robbed us from the opportunity to compare prices with other lenders, robbed us from the excitement of owning our first home, robbed us of our rights.

"Let me begin by saying my situation has been resolved. But there are 100s or people out there with this same issue. 
EDD funds being transferred into closed accounts. Call center people do t know how to handle this issue. And people have to wait 2 weeks or more for BofA to resolve. This is after waiting 2-3 weeks for EDD to approve their claim. 
How could BofA not seen this coming? 

The issue is not with the EDD! Most of the issues around the unemployment disbursements are due in large part to BANK OF AMERICA. 



Case in point. 

I was furloughed from my XXXX  job on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I applied for unemployment in my home state of California. I did this well ahead of most of the people in my state. I received my paperwork in a timely manner. I praise our Governor for having the fortitude and foresight to waive the 2 week waiting period, and trying to streamline the process. 



I filled out my claim paperwork and waited for my card to arrive. After 5 weeks, I still have not received my EDD card in the mail. I had signed up to handle my unemployment account online to streamline the process. From my dashboard I could see the payments are being made to my account. Yet, no debit card On Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX, as the end of the month rapidly approaches, and my bills are coming due, I reach out to Bank of America. The representative tells me, Yes, I do see your account. Your money is being deposited onto your EDD card from 2015. A CLOSED/ARCHIVED ACCOUNT Let me arrange for a new card to be EXPRESS mailed to you. You should receive it Wednesday. 

I asked the representative, What would have happened if I didnt call today to get this ironed out? 

His reply, The money would have gone into this account for an UNSPECIFIED period of time. 

Now it is Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX. I still have not received my EDD debit card. I start the process again with Bank of America. I weave my way through the maze which is their automated We are too busy to take your call messages. The only way I can speak to a representative is the Lost or stolen card option, all other options will disconnect you after they refer you to the EDD website. 
The young lady answering the phone at the Bank of America call center couldnt have been less interested in helping me. She did tell me that the card was sent. She also told me the card was sent regular mail, NOT express, as the first agent had promised. She tells me her hands are tied. There is nothing she can do to get my card to me any sooner than the first or middle of next week. Explaining, she could put a stop on the card that was sent out and reissue another card which will arrive the same day, middle of next week. I call back and speak to a manger, he has only the same flimsy excuse and solution. 

So, due to the complete inept service from Bank of America I will wait a minimum of 8 weeks for my unemployment insurance to reach me. Mean while I will draw from my saving one more time to pay my monthly bills. 

WHAT WAS THEIR PLAN?? Surly someone in the Texas Bank of America EDD office should have seen this coming, right? If not before it happened, AS it was happening! There is NO excuse for their careless, incompetent business ethic. I believe the fiduciary responsibility between Bank of America and the state of California needs to be examined. 

I can not be the only person waiting for their unemployment funds to arrive. I believe most people in my position are pointing their fingers of blame to the unemployment department, when in fact we should be holding Bank of America accountable. 

Please, lets consider using another financial institution to handle our states government issued funds. 

Bank of America only has their best interest at heart.

"Chase Credit Card Statements Chase continually refuses to provide credit card statements that have a XXXX  balance at the end of the billing period, even though there was a beginning balance and activity during the billing period! I believe 12 CFR 1026.7 requires credit card companies to provide XXXX balance statements as long as there is any activity during the billing period ( e.g. payments, credits, charges, etc. ). 

According to your own web site, I read the following guidelines ; "" Otherwise, you should generally receive a statement for every billing cycle in which your account has a credit or charge of more than {$1.00}, or on which a finance charge has been imposed. '' ( see https : //www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-can-i-do-if-i-dont-receive-my-credit-card-bill-en-43/ ). 

For instance, I did not receive the following periodic statements : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. I also did not receive other XXXX balance statements from prior years. It appears that they did provide XXXX  balance statements up through XXXX. 

I do receive XXXX balance statements from many other credit card companies, just not Chase. 

When I worked in the financial industry, one of the things we saw that indicated possible fraud on a credit card was a charge and a credit for just {$1.00} or some other small dollar amount ( to test the validity of the account number ). If a customer does not receive a statement, they would likely not even know that there had been suspicious account activity. 

In summary, my complaint is that Chase refuses to provide XXXX balance statements even though there is activity during the billing period.",Credit card or prepaid card,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,1

I contacted them again, given the time-sensitive nature of the offer, and was told that they would NOT honor the {$50.00} for {$500.00} offer and I would have to spend a full {$1000.00}. So I jumped through a number of hoops to move auto payments around to get that done, only to get another email over a week later ( again, this is a promotion that was only good for a month ) that oh, oops, they'd screwed up, they did have to honor the original offer for {$500.00}. At the same time, I got another offer ( snail mail ) for {$50.00} off {$1000.00}. I asked if they would honor both given that I'd received both. Again, no response. Again, I ask again.

"I am a TDBank Customer in XXXX County, Florida. On XX/XX/2019, I tried to make a XXXX payment through my online banking portal. The transaction was flagged by TDBank as suspicious, even though I had done previous business with the merchant with no issues. TDBank disabled my XXXX capabilities while they "" investigated, '' and later shut down all access to my checking account. I spent HOURS in the branch during the ensuing weekend trying to resolve the situation, but the branch employees, including the manager, not only were unable to help but were apathetic and uninterested in trying. Finally, after I posted a lengthy summary of the situation to XXXX, along with an entreaty to my followers not to do business with TDBank, someone from their corporate office called me on Sunday night and assured me they would resolve the situation by the following Monday morning. Little did I know, however that my nightmare was only getting started ... 

To make a very long story at least somewhat shorter, after the XXXX debacle, TDBank improperly and arbitrarily classified my checking account as a "" non-transaction account, '' a code associated with savings accounts, money markets, and other such accounts on which checks ( including e-checks ) can not be written. They did not inform me they were doing this, and from what their employees have since told me, it should have never happened -- in other words, it was a negligent and careless mistake on their end. 

This negligent action by TDBank caused me to incur many returned payments, resulting in hundreds of dollars in late fees. My payments initially were accepted, but each time, I received a notice days later ( or, in a few cases, weeks later ) from the merchant ( never from TDBank ) that the payment was returned because of my account 's non-transaction status. By that point, the due date had always passed, causing a late fee to be applied. In one case, it took so long for the payment to be returned that it went past the 30-day mark, resulting in a 70-point plunge in my credit score. This drop, unless I can somehow resolve it, will  cause me to pay hundreds or even thousands more in interest if I decide to purchase a house or car in the near future. 

I am completely fed up and need help taking action.

"XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, GA XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CT XXXX XXXX XXXX, GA XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX : Account # XXXX To Whom It May Concern : I have previously sent you a request to validate my debt under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and all I received was an itemized list of the alleged charges you claim I owe you. This does not meet the Federal Trade Commissions guidelines of what constitutes proper debt validation In addition, in the case of Spears Vs. Brennan ( IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF INDIANA, No. 49A02-0003-CV-169 ), the court ruled that : 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) ( emphasis added ). On XX/XX/1996, nineteen days after the date of XXXX debt collection letter, XXXX counsel XXXX sent XXXX a letter declaring that XXXX disputes your debt collection-related allegations, denies the same, and demands strict proof and verification thereof. Record at 21. As such, XXXX should have ceased his debt collection efforts immediately upon receiving that letter. Instead, XXXX proceeded to obtain a default judgment against XXXX on the debt collection claim before he had mailed XXXX the necessary verification and, thus, violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). 

XXXX maintains, however, that there was no violation of the FDCPA because he sent adequate verification of the debt XXXX to XXXX ] in the XX/XX/1996 notice of claim. Brief of Appellee at 13. Specifically, XXXX claims that a copy of the consumer credit contract between XXXX and XXXX XXXX   attached to the notice of claim provided sufficient verification of the debt within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). We can not agree. 

The contract in no way provides sufficient verification of the debt. A review of the document reveals that it identifies only the terms of XXXX loan, including a 17.99 % annual interest rate and the original loan amount of {$2500.00}. The loan agreement contains no accounting of any payments made by XXXX, the dates on which those payments were made, the interest which had accrued, or any late fees which had been assessed once XXXX stopped making the required payments. Indeed, the existing unpaid contract balance at the time XXXX sent the debt collection notice was at least {$350.00} more than the original loan amount. Therefore, XXXX violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) when he failed to cease collection of the debt by obtaining a default judgment against XXXX after XXXX had notified XXXX in writing that he was disputing the debt but before XXXX had mailed verification of the debt to XXXX. We reverse the trial courts entry of summary judgment in favor of XXXX on this issue. 

I notice that you are still reporting this collection on my credit report, which is considered to be a collection activity. You are now in violation of the FCPDA, and are now subject to fines of {$1000.00}, plus actual damages and attorneys fees, which I may collect from you by filing a claim in small claims court. These collections on my credit report are causing me severe problems in trying to purchase a home and the damage could lead into the $ XXXX. 

You should also be aware that reporting such invalidated information to major credit bureaus might constitute defamation of character, as the negative marks on my credit report harm my credit and prevent me from enjoying all the benefits of good credit. In addition, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) does not allow the inaccurate reporting of information on my credit report and under this act. Therefore, if you do not immediately remove this account from my credit report, you are subject to another {$1000.00} fine, plus punitive damages. I'm sure your legal staff will agree that non-compliance with this request could put your company in serious legal trouble with the FTC and other state or federal agencies.

I declined the offer, explaining that I had a better offer from a different lender. Today, I received a loan refinance package from PHH fora fixed rate of 6 % on a 15 year loan. 

I called PHH earlier today and asked to speak with a supervisor regarding this issue. The lady I spoke with said the supervisor on duty was busy and that she would have the gentleman call me. I have not yet received a call back. 

This seems like predatory lending practices and am reporting this for the following reasons : 1 ) The refinance package I received today is 6 % for a 15 year refinance, which is more than twice the rate I was offered on XX/XX/2020. This rate is also significantly higher than rates for similar products, especially given my excellent credit score of over 800. I am attaching a copy of the Loan Estimate and a copy of my credit score as provided in the PHH refinance package.

2 ) I received a refinance package today, even though I verbally declined the offer on XX/XX/2020. 

3 ) The lady I spoke with from PHH on XX/XX/2020 said she just had a couple of questions to get me a rate. She proceeded to walk me through the entire application process, explaining the whole time that it was just another couple of questions. I felt like I was being fed the elephant 1 bite at a time, but kept going on the assurance that we were almost done.",Mortgage,Ocwen Financial Corporation,2

I planned to pay the remaining payments that day however at the dealership was told I would receive a final bill from BMW Financial Services and from there make payments arrangements. In the meantime, I left my leased vehicle thinking I was terminating the lease and when the final bill didn't come, I'm not sure of the date but I called BMW Financial Services only to find out my lease wasn't terminated. I received several letters from BMW Financial Services after telling them I turned my lease in early and would like to pay the remaining payments to terminate the lease early and would like to know my options. 

I paid {$6100.00} on XX/XX/XXXX which was the remaining payments due on my lease and end of lease fees based on a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX.

Now, my credit bureau reflects BMW Financial Services as a negative account in default with a balance owed of {$12000.00}.

XXXX XXXX verified the aph file number, address, last four of my SSN, told me the call was being recorded and then proceeded to inform me that the purpose of her call was to see if I would be willing to settle the order for a fair amount. I advised XXXX XXXX that I would not be agreeing to settle as this is a collection on a fraud account. I begin to ask XXXX XXXX about the identity theft victims complaint and affidavit that was returned to her office and received on XX/XX/XXXX as stated in my previous complaint. XXXX XXXX informed me that the investigation was closed as I did not include a police report with the document when it was returned. I informed XXXX XXXX that I could not obtain a police report and that when I went to the XXXX Police Department I was informed that this case was too old to file a report. I instructed XXXX XXXX to pages 5 & 6 of the identity theft victims complaint and affidavit document and the fact that the document do not only require it to be returned with a police report, but that it could be signed and returned in the presence of a law enforcement officer, a notary, or witness. The form does not state that a police report is required for investigation or if a police report is not included the investigation would not take place and nor was I ever told that by XXXX XXXX. He advised me that an investigation was ongoing and to give it some time. I then asked XXXX XXXX is that the only reason this case was not investigated and XXXX XXXX informed me that she could not tell me that information, but she could only tell me that it did not include a police report therefore the investigation was closed. I  advised her that I have a copy of the identity theft victims complaint and affidavit form and I would be contacting XXXX Police Department to speak with the Chief about filing a report. 
I asked XXXX XXXX about getting information to put on the police report as I only had Aldridge Pite Haan information and I only have XXXX XXXX XXXX name, but no address or contact phone number for them. I informed her that would not be enough or valid information for the police report. I need an address as to where the credit card was sent to or the city or anything that I could use to obtain a police report. XXXX XXXX told me that she could not tell me what to put on the police report. I then asked XXXX XXXX if I should contact XXXX and she told me not to contact XXXX as they no longer was handling this case. I asked if I should contact XXXX XXXX XXXX and she told me not to contact XXXX as her company Aldridge Pite Haan is representing XXXX and I would need to go through them for information about the case. I again asked her if she would provide me with the address as to where the credit card was sent according to XXXX XXXX XXXX as I needed that information to give the police a lead as to where the fraudulent activity took place and she informed me that she could not give me that information. I then asked about contacting the lawyer XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX that is showing up on the court document filed with XXXX County Court and she told me not to contact them either as they were no longer handling this case. I informed her that she was making it impossible for me to obtain a police report as I have no information to give to the police other than Aldride Pite Haan address and contact number. 
XXXX XXXX then proceeded to tell me that she does not know why I keep saying I wasnt served when I filed a response with the court. I informed her that I received a letter in XXXX and upon receiving that letter I immediately went to the XXXX County Court to file a response to that company. XXXX XXXX went on to advise me that the purpose of her call was to make afair offer to settle the case. I asked her what did she consider a fair offer and she gave the amount of {$1400.00}. I told her again no and that I would not be settling as this is a fraud case. She then asked what I would consider a fair settlement and I told her {$100.00} if that. I explained to her that this ordeal has made it impossible for me to pay my mortgage or keep up with my bills and told her the amount that had been collected out of my paycheck up to that date. I inquired about what would happen with my funds if I could get a police report turned in and where was my money at this point. XXXX XXXX told me that she could not guarantee, but if after the police report was received and it was determined to be fraud I could possibly receive my money back even possibly if I agreed to settle and it was determined fraud I could ask for my money back. XXXX XXXX informed me that Aldridge Pite Haan had not received any money as of XX/XX/XXXX and that because of the pandemic happening it could be a while before anything was received by her office. She gave me an update on the balance due as of XX/XX/XXXX of {$1700.00}. 
I informed XXXX XXXX before we got off the phone that I would be reaching out to the Chief of Police at the XXXX Police Department. 
After our call ended I immediately called the XXXX County Superior Court and spoke with XXXX. XXXX reviewed the case as I had several questions about my response. XXXX advised me that I responded to an answer on a contract. That response was due within 30 days of receipt and I made my response on time. XXXX explained that I was not served and that the answer on a contract request did not include a court date as one had not been set at that time. XXXX advised me that after my response in XXXX the XXXX County Superior Court did not receive anything else from XXXX XXXX XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX submitted a document showing that they submitted a Plaintiff Request for Admission of Facts to an address on XX/XX/XXXX and on XX/XX/XXXX the XXXX County Superior Court received a request from XXXX XXXX XXXX requesting a Motion of Summary Judgement. XXXX then informed me of the address listed on the paperwork XXXX XXXX XXXX showed they sent the Plaintiff Request for Admission of Facts and it was to an address that I did not live at during that time. I informed XXXX that I had already been to that apartment complex and got the management company to verify and give me a letter stating that I did not live at that address during the time XXXX XXXX XXXX mailed/submitted those documents. XXXX then went on to explain that me not living at that address and not ever receiving those documents was a problem because I had no way of knowing any court dates set or that I needed to file a response to any documents XXXX XXXX XXXX submitted. I advised her that I needed an address for XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX or something to show an address where the credit card was sent and if it was included in any of the paperwork at the court.

I got a car loan in 2014 I am about to pay of loan off 5 months early. I called Santanders USA to see how much I had left to pay and to find out if this loan would go on my credit report. I went to look a cars a few months earlier and was told that it was not on my report. I was told by Santanders that my co buyer went bankrupted and because of that it would not be reported to the credit bureau on my behalf but that they could send me a receipt for the {$22000.00} I pay for the car. I myself have made all payments for this vehicle each month as the buyer never has the co buyer even been contacted in anyway or made any payments.,Vehicle loan or lease,Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc.,5

"Dear CFPB, Please find my Complaint against Bank of America ( BOA ) for their repetitive refusal to provide me an answer regarding BOA claims to my property ; and their failure to explain why BOA collects my loan payments which suppose to benefit XXXX XXXX investors. 
Based on numerous factual evidence, BOA ( who was the real party who provided financing for my loan by illegally trading my identity on the open market, without my knowledge or consent ), acting through its sham conduits, Countrywide Financial , Inc. ( now renamed as XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX ( XXXX ) and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX ) never placed my loan in any XXXX XXXX Trust ; and instead created for themselves a stream of tax-free revenue from me under glimpse of repayment of debt. In reality, BOA owes me at least 20 % royalty from their derivative trades using my name, my signature, my reputation and my homestead as their collateral, without my knowledge or consent. 
Moreover, BOA and their affiliates XXXX, XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX monopolized VA appraisals services to generate overstated appraisals to increase BOAs trading value. The Appraisal for my property was done by a la moda software ( long-time used by XXXX until they purchased it in XX/XX/XXXX ) and came at {$140000.00} while amount of financing was {$130000.00}. Thus, BOA sold my identity on the open market for at least 3-4 times more, based on the property appraised value and received at least {$430000.00} ( $ XXXX x 3 ) of which {$130000.00} were forwarded to XXXX XXXX branch in XXXX XXXX, CA where XXXX XXXX , XXXX ( XXXX ) ( who impersonated as a Lender ) sent my private information on XX/XX/XXXX. It is evident from Commitment letter which was prepared by XXXX which stated that I will buy XXXX debt product. 
From day one my application was handled in California, and this is evident from time when I signed via some clout email located on someones server which was working on Pacific time. XXXX was merely an another conduit for BOA which they use to mislead borrowers and conceal BOAs involvement in lending practices and protect BOAs stream of revenue from trading on borrowers identity without their knowledge or consent. 
XXXX XXXX  branch is operated by Mr. XXXX XXXX, a relative of XXXX XXXX, co-founder of Countrywide Financial , Inc ( whom BOA used as their sham conduit since at least XX/XX/XXXX, or after President William Clinton repelled Glass Steagal Act ) XXXX XXXX worked for Countrywide since XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, thus  was actively participating in the biggest economic fraud in the Worlds history operated by Investment banks, each of whom had its own cover up, like Countrywide ( BOA ; XXXX ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) In XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX, who was controlled by BOA, knew that their lending practices are illegal, and decided to create a fake corporation Americas Wholesale Lender ( AWL ) to potentially shield Countrywide   from liabilities. 

AWL Countrywide ( read : Bank of America ) fraudulently created 3.5 MILLION loans at taxpayer expense with a scheme so simple it seems impossible they got away with it at all. Instead of becoming licensed and registered in every state, Countrywide simply made up a trade name ( DBA ) that they could register in every state that would slide under the radar of the regulators. They made up the innocuous name Americas Wholesale Lender and got to work. Their scheme worked and nobody noticed that Americas Wholesale Lender wasnt a corporation registered or licensed to do business in their state. Countrywide created 3.5 MILLION loans across every state in the country under the DBA Americas Wholesale Lender. The catch is that a DBA such as Americas Wholesale Lender is not a legal entity. It is simply a trade name. Countrywide figured that, if caught, they could avoid punishment by claiming that it was all a clerical error.

After they made the loans, Countrywide never sold them to a securitized trust as they were required to do by the pooling agreements. Instead, the loans were controlled by Bank of America ( BOA ). As a result, BOA was collecting payments and foreclosing on loans despite the fact that it never owned or funded any of the actual loans.

BOA continues the same criminal practices as of today ; and never sold my loan to any securitized XXXX XXXX Trust but instead control my loan though their sham   conduits still operated by Countrywide executives, under different corporate names XXXX and XXXX, none of whom have any documentation to provide any proof of their legitimate rights to collect from me. All my payments are collected by BOA who sent me threatening Notices of Default from their XXXX office. 
After the creation of AWL, Bank of America needed to find a way to make it so that AWLI could make no claims to the loans. What they did was get MERS to create an assignment on behalf of AWLI which assigned the loan to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX, XXXX XXXX, or XXXX XXXX. After these fraudulent assignments, the bank attaches them to their foreclosure proceedings to trick the court into believing it is the legal owner of the loan. 

All of these XXXX XXXX fraudulent loans have been fully repaid by taxpayers in the TARP bailout while BOA collected enormous profits, at least {$12.00} per dollar. 
This is exactly that BOA did to my loan they used name of MERS as a Mortgagee ( which MERS can not be since they have no agency relation with XXXX XXXX and not even registered to conduct business in Michigan due to lack of corporate registration. MERS, who under XXXX XXXX MBS Guide must publish the name of the Trust where my VA loan is held ; as well as name of the loans pool never did it since here are no Trust ; no XXXX XXXX pool and no mortgagee MERS. No surprise that XXXX and XXXX claim that details of securitization are proprietory because here was no securitization of my loan, just pure revenue for BOA. 
BOA continues exactly the same practices, with exactly the same people XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, ect but added another layer of protection such as fictitious Lenders like XXXX XXXX to more secretly defraud customers and the US Government ; while avoid billions of taxes collecting revenues from borrowers who think that they pay debt to legitimate investors. 
According to Office of Comptrollers XX/XX/XXXX Report, BOAs current exposure to NOTIONAL derivatives is about {$12.00} dollars per dollar ( total BOAs assets {$1.00} XXXX, derivatives {$20.00} XXXX ) which BOA made by selling my home for at least 12 times more than the amount financed though their table financing practices. 
Based on my very modest estimate, BOA and their co-conspirators XXXX, XXXX and their owners XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX ( who forged my loan documents ) all made very substantial profits reselling my identity, in the total amount at least {$20.00} dollars per dollar and made at least {>= $1,000,000} based on $ XXXX appraisal. 
Therefore, BOA owes me at least 20 % royalties from trades, or {$580000.00}, which is customary royalties paid by oil and gas companies to land owners. 
Despite the fact that BOA never lent me a single cent ; and collected very substantial profits from trades ( on top of tax-free gifts I make them each month ) BOA on numerous occasions claimed some rights to my property while failed to identify which rights BOA might have ; under which law ; and in which capacity. 
On their most resent respond BOA again evaded any answers to my direct questions and falsely stated that my concerns were addressed by their lawyer on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I disagree. BOA, whose headquarters are in North Carolina, but who sends me letters from their California XXXX XXXX office hired unethical and professionally incompetent Pennsylvania lawyer who is not licensed neither in NC or CA or MI to address a debt collection and property rights dispute located in Michigan. 
BOAs lawyer not only does not have a legal license to practice law in any of these states MI, NC or CA but created more concerns since he insisted that BOA claims rights to TWO of my loans while I am only aware of one. 
I respectfully request CFPB to submit my complaint and demand for explanations to Bank of America which rights BOA claims to my loan ; under which law BOA claims its rights ; in which capacity BOA claims its rights ; and to which second loan BOA claims its rights if I only have one loan. 
I also demand BOA to pay me royalties from all trades involving my property ( based on {$140000.00} amount in trade bets ) ; refund me all illegally collected money ; and compensate me for all damages, including treble damages for fraud ; racket ; ect. total {$5.00} XXXX in damages.

The instructed us to make 3 trial payment each being due before the last day of the month. We made first trial payment On XX/XX/XXXX. When I tried to make our second payment on XX/XX/XXXX Caliber home loans agent XXXX that the could not take mh payment as Caliber had transfeted my loan to a new mortgager. I never recieved any notice that this was going to happen. Yhr then told me that I would need to make the second payment to our new mortgager! First off ... they gave Mr the wrong contact information for the new mortgager and I called back s again recieved the same incorrect information. I was the able to find them by searching the web and made contact. The new mortgager ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) they told me ..yes my loan was being transferred to them however they would not officially take it over until the XXXX, and that I should make mr payment to Caliber. I called Caliber back and again was told ... no ..I had to pay it to the new loan mortgager as we don't manage you loan anymore. So again I called back to XXXX  and told them again what Caliber had said and again they told me that they do not own my loan yet. So come the following Monday I called Caliber again. I got the same answer. In addition they informed me that because I missed the payment date that I would be no longer eligible for the modification because I didn't meet the modification requirements even though they refuse to take the payment. So I had to wait in for XXXX  to completely have all of my information and officially take over my loan after the XXXX to speak with them. Once I did inform them again what happened and they asked me to send them proof that I was a approved for a modification from caliber. I faxed them the acceptance paperwork from caliber showing that I did qualify and what my trial payments were. A few weeks went by I hadn't heard anything from XXXX  so I contacted them again. Then for me at the time that they didn't receive my paperwork even though I had an fax confirmation. I then re faxed it again to XXXX. Few weeks more went by I heard nothing. I called back to XXXX and basically they told me that caliber sent them a letter saying that they had put me a caliber put me into foreclosure which I was never told that and I shouldn't have been as I was going through the process of them with for the modification. XXXX said they didn't receive very much information from caliber and that they were trying to get more information about it. That they would let me know. Of course nobody ever let me know anything. Then few weeks more went by I called back and they at that time asked me to email or fax their packet for modification or assistance. Sorry did that and also send them again another copy of the approval had gotten from caliber for modification. About 5 weeks went by and we just received a letter now stating that congratulations you are approved to short sale your home and deed in lieu. Congratulations!!! How is that congratulating me that I'm going to lose my house is viewed as a good thing!! I thought they were trying to help me! But now I feel like all they're trying to do is take my property!! Of course I called them really upset. Ask to speak to a manager. Spoke with her at length basically the girl on the phone to answer the phone originally told me I owe it doesn't matter they are going to review it again pretty much that's their decision so there's nothing you can do about it. Problem also is that I have a FHA loan XXXX XXXX loan and I know there are guidelines they must follow when there are the FHA loan provider. I provided them all of the information but in their letter they sent me congratulating me that I was going to lose my house, it says things that aren't correct like it says did not Mark that this is my primary residence when I know it did that was the very first thing on their questionnaire for Mortgage Assistance I asked that box and huge X I also says that we didn't give them any any of the information they ask for for my wife 's XXXX which I sent them even the doctors proof of illness. I said them all the same thing that I sent caliber. I just feel at this point that they're don't want to deal with me and they're trying to take my property! I spoke to XXXX XXXX and they are going to investigate also. But these companies seem to all be really the same they're very poor quality and the customer service is really lacking their phone stuff doesn't work half the time you can't get ahold of anybody and when you do all you always get the same answer I don't know we can't help you or the things I get all the time.

"This complaint is based on violations of the FDCPA and the FCRA by Eastern Account System ( Eastern ). 

___ On XX/XX/XXXX, I reviewed my XXXX  credit report and saw a collection account reported by Eastern for a {$65.00} medical debt. I only just discovered the account from my credit report. Eastern never sent me a letter with a notice that I had a right to dispute the debt. 

___ On XX/XX/XXXX, I disputed the debt with Eastern by certified mail. 

___ Eastern did not respond to my letter and did not validate the debt. 

___ In my letter, I gave Eastern notice that I will also dispute the account with the credit bureaus. According to federal court decisions, if a debt collector verifies an account to a credit bureau before validating the debt, that is a violation of the FDCPA for failing to cease collection of the debt. Here is case law on this : Until the debt was verified, all further attempts to collect on the debt, including defendants XX/XX/XXXX letter and any subsequent reports to the credit reporting agencies, violated 1692g ( b ). Semper v. JBC Legal Group, 2005 WL 2172377, *4 ( W.D. Wash. 2005 ) [ emphasis added ]. 

___ On XX/XX/XXXX, I disputed the unverified Eastern account with XXXX. 

___ On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX  sent me the results of the re-investigation. Eastern failed to cease collection of the debt because they falsely verified the unverified debt to a credit bureau. 

___ Also according to federal court decisions, the failure of Eastern to provide account-level documentation to validate the debt means that they had no such materials to rely on when they verified the account to XXXX. Here is case law on this as well A jury could also find that because [ the debt collector ] retained the right to seek account-level documentation through its agreements with [ the creditors ] [ it ] behaved unreasonably when it reported the accounts as verified without first exercising those rights. Hinkle v. Midland Credit Management , Inc., et al No. 3:2013cv00033 ( S.D. Ga. 2015 ). 

___ Based on the aforementioned facts, Eastern violated the FDCPA and FCRA. 

___ ( a ) Violation of the FDCPA 15 USC 1692g ( b ) in that they failed to cease collection of the disputed and unverified debt. 

___ ( b ) Violation of the FDCPA 15 USC 1692e ( 2 ) ( A ) in that they misrepresented the character, amount of legal status of the debt. 

___ ( c ) Violation of the FCRA 15 USC 1681s-2 ( b ) in that they failed to conduct a reasonable investigation of my dispute thru a credit reporting agency. 

___ DAMAGES : I was denied credit due to the unverified collection account that Eastern wrongfully verified to a credit bureau.

"My loans are subject to income based repayment. I sent in the required, requested documentation through both the studentloans.gov site and uploading the documents to the Fedloan site itself. I received notice that it was denied. I called in and asked why. They told me I filed for re-certification too early. I just had to wait until the last payment of the previous term had posted. Then they would process the application. Time went by. I checked the site and called the company to ask if everything was ok. I was assured it was. All the necessary pieces were there and ok. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I called again to check since it was taking long and I wanted to be sure I had everything. The rep then assured me I did. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a paper letter in the mail informing me that I was missing information. It arrived late in XX/XX/XXXX. I receive paper mail because electronic forms are unreliable as I live in a California county that has been on fire every year for the last 4 years and now is subject to XXXX XXXX XXXX forced power outages. Both were true In XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/2019 ; there was a large fire just near my home and three power outages that lasted collectively well over a week. Consequently, in mid XXXX, I received the denial. I immediately called Fedloan on XX/XX/XXXX. The rep on the phone was helpful, she said I made it on time and filed the application right then on the phone. 
I then received, on XX/XX/XXXX, notice that my IBR was recalculated to {$93.00}. 
I received no further contact from Fedloan until I noticed that the XX/XX/XXXX bill had gone up by {$200.00}. I called to ask why since I had filed everything on time, had followed up regularly with the company, and responded to every notice and request in a reasonable time frame. The rep I spoke to on XX/XX/XXXX told me that it was because I didn't have the appropriate information on my pay stub. Information I had provided in at least one phone call before the XX/XX/XXXX call. He said that, even though I responded in a reasonable time, they had "" sent the XX/XX/XXXX bill out already '' and so not only was I charged {$200.00} more that month but {$1700.00} of interest had been capitalized. That even though I could not have done anything different, made any changes to my actions, did everything as I should, Fedloan would not correct the processing error. I asked at that time what I had asked on earlier calls, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX : Why is there a problem with my pay stub now when there wasn't a problem with that exact same structured pay stub earlier in the year when I applied then? The rep wouldn't say. I also asked why the person I spoke with on XX/XX/XXXX didn't tell me that there was a denial. Surely they would have at least that much information since the denial had been mailed that day. He made a noncommittal response about the application not having been "" processed '' at the time of the call. 
He just said that they followed all their procedures and notified me by email and on the website. I told him I had called several times and I can not babysit the website because I don't have reliable power. I do not thing that notice times are legally based on one day turnarounds through email notice. I did not receive the email. I received paper notice, I responded in a reasonable time from receipt.

"I was in the hospital late last year due to a rare XXXX. All of the $ XXXX I was billed went to my health insurance and was paid, subject to co-pays. No issues there. In XXXX of this year, I attempted to refinance my mortgage and discovered 4 collection items on my account. This did not allow me to refinance my mortgage at the time of the low rates and cost me about {$70000.00} long-term. 

I was able to contact the collections company with info obtained by my mortgage broker. They advised these were bills from when I was in the hospital. They advised that these had already been submitted to my insurance company. I advised that was impossible, as I wasn't even aware of these bills. They later agreed. 

The collections company agreed to submit to my health insurance. Two weeks later, they have still not done so. The collection company would not give me information for this company that supposedly billed me and sent me to collections, so I had to dig online. 

After a couple weeks, I found this company "" XXXX XXXX ''. I called them earlier this week and they advised that they had sent me one letter ( while I was still in hospital ) and texted my phone ( not even sure what phone I had when I was in hospital ). During the call, I gave them my health insurance info, and they advised they would send to my insurance company and notify the collections company to remove the accounts.

"Hi, The issue I want to raise here is the refusal of Citi bank to credit back ( refund ) my annual fees that they promised to refund me. 

I had a Citi / XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Credit Card which carried an annual fee of {$50.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was charged the {$50.00} annual fee for the period of XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. I called Citi Credit Card department ( henceforth referred to as "" Citi '' ) around XXXX XX/XX/XXXX to see if they could waive the fee off ( they usually have different deals to waive fees off ). They did provide me a deal, but I refused since it was not a good deal. So during that call, the Citi rep asked me to call back later to check for a new deal. 

Again in XXXX I called back again ( around XXXX XXXX I believe, but don't remember the exact date XXXX to check for a new deal. Since there were no new deals, I asked the rep to cancel my account. Before canceling the account, I asked her about the fees and she said that the fees would be refunded back to me at the end of next billing cycle. Therefore I asked her to cancel my account. She canceled it and told me that the negative balance of XXXX {$25.00} ( at the closure of my account, it had a negative balance ) would be refunded back immediately and the {$50.00} annual fees would be refunded back at the end of next billing cycle. But to be doubly sure, I called back again a few minutes later to make sure that my fees will be refunded to me. The new rep on the line told me the same thing and said that the negative balance of XXXX {$25.00} would be refunded back immediately and the {$50.00} fees would be refunded back at the end of next billing cycle. 

Within 5 days, I saw my ~ {$25.00} back in the account. But even after waiting until the end of next billing cycle, I did not receive the {$50.00} fees back to my account. So I started contacting them ( around late XXXX ). But due to Covid-19 the wait times were long and after several attempts ( including once waiting for almost 4 hours on the call ) I could not get hold of anyone. Then I found about their in-app message support system. So using the Citi XXXX app I contacted a Citi rep on this issue and they replied back saying that the fees can not be refunded because I closed the account more than 37 days after being charged the fee! I tried contacting them again in XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, and different reps ( a few in XXXX and one of them in US ) always told me the same reason for not refunding the fee! 

This is ridiculous since during my cancellation call ( in XX/XX/XXXX XXXX the Citi rep never told me that and instead assured me the fee would be refunded. Even on my second call that same day ( card cancelation day in XX/XX/XXXX ), a different rep assured me that my fees would be refunded. But because I have no proof of the same, Citi is refusing to refund my {$50.00} fee! I would have never canceled my card if the rep had told me that day that the fee would not be refunded. Now after just using the card of about 2 months, Citi has charged me an entire year 's worth of fee. They promised me to refund back the fee on cancelation, but now refuse to refund me my fees! 

The big problem here is that, in such cases the customer never has proof of what was conversed in a call and therefore has no way to prove it. And that way, Citi can keep refusing to refund fees to a customer and the customer would become powerless, without a way to get their money back. On one hand a rep can lie to you and then days/months later another rep will say something else and you would have no way to prove what the first rep told you. 

The sad part for me here is that I have been a long time Citi Credit card and Citi banking customer. I have 2 credit cards and a bank account as well and yet they lie to their customer and refuse to refund them the promised fees.

I do not have any account, contract, or business relationship with Frontline Asset Strategies, XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX XXXX. I disputed this debt within 30 days of receipt of their letter and on XX/XX/2019 I had sent Frontline Asset Strategies a written notice requesting validation of this debt and had sent it via USPS Certified Mail with signed delivery confirmation requested. I had indicated that this is NOT a request for verification or proof of my mailing address, but a request for VALIDATION made pursuant to 15 USC 1692g Sec. 809 ( b ) of the FDCPA. I requested that their offices provide me with competent evidence that I have any legal obligation to pay them. I had specifically requested that they provide me with a copy of the agreement that bears the signature of the alleged debtor wherein he/she agreed to pay the creditor as well as a copy of the agreement with their client that grants them the authority to collect on the alleged debt. I had received signed delivery confirmation from the U.S.  Postal Service indicating that my correspondence to Frontline Asset Strategies was received and signed for on XX/XX/2019.

Frontline had attached copies of billing statements for a XXXX XXXX account with their correspondence, however, they had failed to provide the requested verification of any signed contract or agreement that bears a signature. In essence, they essentially admit that they are unable to provide proof of a signed contract at this time since the only information provided by them was copies of billing statements. Copies of billing statements are not sufficient proof of a legally binding signed agreement or contract. 
On XX/XX/2019, I had also received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX indicating that they manage the account for XXXX XXXX XXXX and that they had initiated a review of the inquiry they had received.

"Hi, I am writing this letter/notice of complaint because I feel that there are companies and agencies that are falsely impersonating U.S. Government agencies and personnel and as a result are and have fraudulently taken advantage of U.S. citizens such as myself. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I was on the world wide web just browsing when I saw a Student Loan Relief Program ad and it was mentioning having a program that could assist people with consolidating and possibly eliminating Student Loan debt. The ad had some sort of 800 number to call to inquire and see if you could qualify. Being I was suffering tremendously XXXX from coping with medical and student loan debt along with other problems, I was extremely curious to learn and discover if I could get any relief with my student loan debt so I called the number the ad listed and spoke to a gentleman whom said his name was XXXX XXXX. Over the course of about 30 mins, XXXX XXXX had asked me all sorts of questions such as my date of birth, social security number, income information, company and field information, household size and more. 
XXXX told me that based off my income and occupation of working for an agency that services the general public, I met the qualifications for the Student Loan Relief Program. He told me that to sign up for and to take advantage of the program, he would have to run a credit check on me to see if the program would finance me for what they called a service fee for the program but said that all I would have to pay would be {$39.00} a month for 2 years and gave the notion and promise that my student loans would be eliminated. XXXX then said that he would need to send me some documents via email for me to sign along with me sending copies of my paystubs for the past 30 days and I did so. 
When the email came to my email inbox, I noticed that it was from a two other and separate entities ( companies ) but all documents pointed one another back to the Student Loan Relief Department which to my ignorance and understanding was all the Federal Government. These two companies were the Manhattan Beach Venture LLC, and XXXX XXXX XXXX. Per XXXX XXXX, they were the company to run my credit for a request authorization and added and opened a line of credit in my name and account for the {$1300.00} that they stated they paid to Manhattan Beach Venture LLC to finance me for the program for services. Please note and be advised that to this very day, I have never been able to speak to anyone at Manhattan Beach Venture to inquire about my case and account. XXXX XXXX XXXX, however, are the company and agency whom are to this present day of XX/XX/XXXX, are auto debiting {$39.00} from my checking account. 
Over the course of 2 years, I have called XXXX XXXX to inquire about the validity and justification of their program and all I get is a bounce around and shift of responsibility back to Manhattan Beach Venture and the Student Loan Relied Department. Then about a year ago or maybe more, I began to receive emails from a company called XXXX XXXX whom XXXX XXXX has added to yet another 3rd party ordeal. Representatives from XXXX XXXX say that they hired XXXX XXXX to come in and handle the document preps for customers whom when recertifications are due. Once introduced to XXXX XXXX about a year ago, that is when I started getting a gut feeling that something was not right and began to feel that my identity, banking information and more was compromised and that I being taken advantage of so I immediately called into the Federal Student Loan contact line to inquire about my loan status. I was then brought to the awareness that what XXXX XXXX and Manhattan Beach were doing was simply and solely placing my student loan accounts and payments on a deferment plan. My student loan debt amounts have not decreased at all and are very much still present. 
Just yesterday XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX XXXX XXXX to inquire about the length of time I had left before they would seize from auto-debiting my bank account and was told I still had over 18 months left to pay the {$39.00}. I then became utterly and extremely perplexed about what exactly it was that this company was actually doing for me versus to me so I asked for justification and proof and was told I would be mailed the documents showing and proving that XXXX XXXX did indeed pay Manhattan Beach Ventures LLC a total of {$1300.00} however I have learned that in situations like this, there is and will never be an actual file that would be provided to me to prove that XXXX XXXX paid that amount of money on my behalf and are rightly justified in them debiting funds from me. All the while, I would be paying them nearly 5 years and would still have the student loan debt that I began with only the amounts will increase due to the forbearance and interests. 
Since having all these gut feelings and proof that someone is taking advantage of me by way of government fraud, I have searched the web and the XXXX   XXXX XXXX  to look up information and complaints against the Manhattan Beach Venture LLC and XXXX XXXX XXXX and to my surprise many others have the same story as I do and feel compromised and scammed.",Debt collection,"Manhattan Beach Venture, LLC",0

"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, La. XXXX Re : Home Depot Credit Services/Citibank, N.A Home Depot Account number : XXXX & XXXX XX/XX/XXXX To Whom It May Concern : The reason I am filing this complaint with your agency is due to Home Depot/Citibank, N.A offering me a high APR interest rate of my Home Depot credit card account. On XX/XX/XXXX, when I applied for credit with Home Depot my credit scores were XXXX  XXXX & XXXX  XXXX, and I should have qualified for a lower APR interest rate. I also never miss any payments and my account never went into default and what is also upsetting that Home Depot also  refuses to apply any overpayments above the minimum to the promotional balance rather than all of it being applied to the revolving balance. I was never properly disclosed that I was told for that to happen I needed to contact the credit department to put in a request to have payments properly applied before promotion expire. According to the Home Depot agreement, Home Depot/Citibank, N.A on qualified account holders offered an APR interest rate between 17.99 % - 26.99 with credit approval. With my excellent credit score, I shouldve been offered a lower APR interest rate, instead of a 25.99 % APR interest rate. I believe Home Depot/Citi Bank shouldve offered me a lower APR interest rate instead of the regular interest rate of 25.99 % at the time when I have applied for the Home Depot account. I would greatly appreciate if you could please investigate this matter for due fairness. Thank you in advance for your prompt response regarding this critical issue.

Your concern is that the charges for this visit appear on your credit report, and that you were XXXX eligible at the time of service, Treviewed this visit and located the eligibility inquiry our registrar submitted on the XXXX website.

"Hello, I accrued a debt from an apartment complex judgement in XX/XX/XXXX. As specifically directed by the complex, I paid the debt to Hunter Warfield in XX/XX/XXXX. Debt remained on my credit report after repeatedly notifying ALL parties involved from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. I was unable to rent an apartment in my name for YEARS ( XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX to be exact ). 
I believe the collection agency committedseveral violations ( FDCPA and others ) Including but not limited to : 807. False or misleading representations 808. Unfair practices ( 1 ) 809. Validation of debts 812. Furnishing certain deceptive forms 813. Civil liability ( Specifically B-1 ) -the frequency and persistence of noncompliance by the debt collector, the nature of such noncompliance, and the extent to which such noncompliance was intentional I have every single receipt, email correspondence, credit report, direct dispute to the credit bureaus, complaint #, Attorney/Firm of record information, rental application, adverse action letter, video, audio etc ... to validate my beliefs. The collection agency is also aware of our interactions over the years. 

The collection agency is not only blatantly rude and egregiouslydeceptive at every turn, they are also extremely reliant on the statute of limitations. However, I recently discoveredthe court and law firm of record was never paid nor notified the debt was satisfied. Credit reports no longer report judgments butto this day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I have an unpaid judgement in my name until XX/XX/XXXX. The statute of limitations on a civil judgement is 10 years. Legally I am still subject to garnishment if anyone ever tried to pursue action. It is my belief, that they acted fully as creditor and in doing so violatedTennessee Code Title 26. Execution 26-2-217 : ( 2 ) The judgment creditor shall notify the court clerk of the balance due upon a judgment whenever the creditor causes the issuance or revival of a garnishment thereon. Furthermore, the judgment creditor shall notify the court clerk when the judgment has been satisfied. Tenn. Code 26-2-217 Please note, there is NO DISPUTE from either party that the debt was paid in XX/XX/XXXX. The issue, as I believe, is that they want to separate the judgement from the debt and deny responsibility forall related items that appeared on my credit report ; yet, they acted fully on their client 's behalf when they accepted the payment ( and approved it's deletion in XX/XX/XXXX ). I can also prove that even if it is two separate issues, even their client was unaware of this arrangement. 

This issueis from my very first apartment. As a regular adult, I could not simply give up my attempt to provide shelter.

"Chase fraudulent charges I am writing to dispute JP Morgan Chase Banks decision of denying reimbursement of fraudulent charges to my savings account ending in XXXX. 

My husband and I noticed fraudulent charges onto our savings account on XX/XX/XXXX. We immediately called Chase fraud services to report. They took the info down and started a claim. We received a letter with the info of the claim ( see attachment ). There were a total of six fraudulent charges on our account. We did not initially notice the first four, as they were smaller amounts. We had a large sum of money in our savings at this time, and did not notice a small amount missing. 

As soon as we noticed the large amounts, we notified Chase. We, then, received a second letter the following day ( XXXX ). It states that Chase isnt going to reverse the charges on the most recent fraudulent transactions because the first ones are more than 60 days old. 

We then went to our local Chase branch in XXXX, OH on Monday, XXXX XXXX. We spoke with a representative, XXXX. We explained the situation to her and she immediately said, I am only the middle man. She proceeded to call the fraud department while we were in her cubical. After getting off phone with fraud dept. she explained to us this 60 day law as she called it. She says, They can not break the law and that the FDIC made it up and they have no control over it. We explained to her that XXXX  XXXX  is willing to cover all the charges and reimburse us provided that Chase contact them, letting them know it was a fraudulent charge. She told the Fraud dept. this. After hanging up with the fraud dept she said they told her that theyre still unwilling to reimburse the fraud transactions, but they did file a claim with XXXX XXXX. She said we didnt need to do anything at that point but to wait for XXXX XXXX to credit the account. Meanwhile she closed out our Savings account and moved our money to our checking account. 

XXXX proceeded to blame us for the fraudulent charges on our savings account. She told us how we shouldve had our alerts on and that wouldve notified us of the fraudulent charges. I asked XXXX repeatedly about the XXXX XXXX   account being in a name completely different from either of ours. Her response was that anyone can use anyone elses account. We dont know who you let use your account. I believe she meant a XXXX XXXX account. I hope she did not mean savings!! Regardless, if she meant XXXX, NO!!! You can not let someone else use your account. And the account was never verified as being the correct account. ( per XXXX  XXXX  ). I asked her why it didnt raise a red flag to them having someone else debiting out of my savings. She said it didnt seem out of the ordinary since we had our sons college tuition debited ( only two times ever! ) out of our account, when the first two fraud debits were done months before! This doesnt add up to what she is telling us. Chase has taken no responsibility and XXXX put all the blame on us. 

To set the record straight, I had every available alert on to my knowledge. When I told XXXX this, she stated, well there are always new alerts Chase is coming out with. How are we, the consumer, supposed to know this? We were never given any info that there were new alerts on our app. Also what if we did not use an app. Then what? When does Chase have to take responsibility? When are they held accountable for the security of their customers money? 

XXXX also stated that this kind of thing happens a lot. It even happened to her husband. If Chase knows this why did they not inform their customers to be alert and pay attention to their accounts because this scam was going on. Why wasnt Chase doing anything to protect its customers. Per XXXX, Chase was aware of how scammers take out small amounts at first, then waited after the 60 days, then took out large amounts. They knew this!! What accountability do they have knowing this??? They did nothing to protect us as customers. 

I have attached documents that show the un- reimbursed amounts along with the dates. If you need I can provide pics of my bank account transactions. Please let me know if you need further evidence of the fraudulent transactions. 

I spoke with XXXX several times, and received the same answers from each person I spoke with. On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX, I spoke with a representative, XXXX. I explained the situation. XXXX stated that Chase just has to reverse or dispute the charges and they will reimburse our account. XXXX also stated that the bank is able to see the name attached with the transactions. ( if thats the case, why did Chase let these transactions go through without concern? ). XXXX instructed us to contact Chase and cancel our account and he did the same on his end so no more charges could occur from that XXXX account or our Savings account. XXXX stated the name associated with the fraudulent XXXX account is XXXX XXXX. He asked if we knew of this person. I explained that I had no clue of this person. 

I spoke with a XXXX, and XXXX from XXXX XXXXl, to have them say the same things. They said that Chase does have the means to reverse the ACH transaction and to be able to dispute it as a fraudulent charge. XXXX states they have NEVER had a bank that wouldnt reverse the ACH charge. She said theyre capable and should be willing. XXXX states they are willing to reimburse the account but need the banks help. I got the phone number and case number to give to Chase. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, after still not receiving any kind of reimbursement, we went to our local Chase branch again. This time we spoke with XXXX XXXX. She called Chase fraud dept. with the same results. She did print out the letter that chase gave us to send to XXXX XXXX. She again reminded us of the 60day law but said if XXXX is willing to reimburse the account she would try and help. I called XXXX at XXXX on the XXXX and left a message with the claim number ( XXXX ) and phone number XXXX to call XXXX XXXXl directly. 

When I spoke with XXXX at XXXX, she stated that there is not a fax number or email to send a letter to. Also, that the bank needed to dispute the ACH charges and that is the only way to get money back. XXXX said that the bank does know how to do that and there is no reason they shouldnt. 

We would like the following to be the outcome of this complaint : 1. We DEMAND a full refund of all the six fraudulent charges, from Chase Bank. We dont care how they do it. They can contact XXXX as asked or just simply refund our money into our checking account ( as our savings is closed ).

2. The refunded amount needs to be XXXX which is the total amount of all six fraudulent charges. ( $ XXXX has been temporarily refunded- this needs to be permanent. ) 3. We DEMAND to be compensated for our lost work time and suffering. The amount to be compensated for this is {$300.00}. We both lost 1.5 hours of work. This equals about {$200.00}. The other {$100.00} is for the time and effort put into research and fighting this battle.

4. We would like their to be a policy in place to let customers know of their 60 day policy in regards to the fraudulent charges.

5. We would like there to be a policy put into place for Chase and its representatives to red flag fraudulent charges and to have a better safety guard for this.

6. We demand Chase and its representatives change the verbiage they use for the FDIC 60 day policy. They need to not tell customers its a law and they can not break it. When in fact, its an institutional policy of Chase. That is misrepresenting the truth to your own advantage.

7. We demand Chase to prove that two AcH transactions to a college ( even though we have two college accounts attached to us ) justifies it being normal for our savings to have ACH transactions. which led Chase, per XXXX, to overlook those fraudulent transactions. ( dont forget the first two fraudulent transactions were months before! ) Our demands are based on the facts that Chase is negligent on being held accountable for poor monitoring of accounts that have fraudulent charges.

Chase is guilty of putting blame on the customer and taking no responsibility for its lack of actions or protection of its customers.

Chase has lied about this 60 day law that we were quoted over and over. The law states on the FDIC website that consumers MAY not get their money back if over sixty days. Does not say its a law and doesnt say they WILL NOT! 
Chase must not be allowed to use this verbiage! 

We have never had a XXXX account attached to any Chase account. This should have raised a red flag to Chase. 

It is so rare for a XXXX account to be linked to a savings account. I would like Chase to prove how many savings accounts in comparison to other types of accounts ( like checking or credit card ) to prove it is not common at all. Even the reps from XXXX XXXX were shocked this happened to a savings account. 

The most important reason that Chase should give our refund is because XXXX XXXX  is WILLING to reimburse the money!!! There is no reason Chase shouldnt reverse the ACH charges or dispute them. What reason do they have? They arent going to be paying us back, XXXX would be.

I called the Fraud Prevention Department for Wells Fargo and explained to the specialist that I received information of my account closure and reported that I was a victim of a robbery on XX/XX/XXXX informing them that my phone, wallet which included my ID, SS card and credit/debit cards were stolen and the check deposit on XX/XX/XXXX was not made by me.

I placed the card in my wallet and didnt think anything of it since there was no reason for me to use the card at the time, so I did forget the pin was attached to my card.

However, in accordance with this provision no rejections without a "" fair process '' are acceptable. 
I asked Miss XXXX to get a copy of this advisory in order to send it to their business bankers, and she refused to read it and to take it. After my persistence she took a copy of the Fincen Advisory without any real interest. 
Therefore, I consider a potential violation of our rights as MSB pursuant the Fincen Advisory XX/XX/XXXX second paragraph. This advisory was issued jointly by Fincen and  the "" Federal Banking Agencies '' ( The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision ). 
Therefore, no one internal policy can stand against this Fincen and Federal Banking Agencies provision, non Bank of America. 
Then, pursuant the Fincen Advisory XX/XX/XXXX, with all respect I request hereby thru CPFB, First.- Send this complain to the headquarters of Bank of America to their reconsideration thru a "" fair '' process, that usually includes a general questionnaire form, the copy of our AML Program , Training process and records, Compliance Officer, and Independent review ( The 4 pillars of a MSB ) ( 31 CFR 103.125 ), Authorized Delegate Verification Letters from Money Transmitters XXXX bank statements from the current bank, visitation to the business, curriculum of the owner, etc. Then, if every thing is under the BSA and the Law, opening the account to the MSB petitioner its mandatory. 
Second.- Send this complain to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for its analysis.

Third.- Send this complaint to FINCEN Financial Crimes Enforcement Network for its analysis.

Forth.- Send this complaint to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for its analysis.

Instead when I applied and approved -no credit card information was provided at the end of the transaction. I had to wait for the hard copy, relocate the offer and book my flight. 

At the end of the transaction the web page did not display the {$200.00}. savings. I called XXXX and was assured it would be credited after I made any purchase "" even a cup of coffee '' on the card. I never got credit on my Chase statement after spending {$900.00}. on the account, so I contacted Chase directly. I spoke to two customer service reps who told me they couldn't help me or verify that there ever was an offer of {$200.00}. off at the time I applied for the card. I then spoke to a manager in the corporate office in XXXX Ohio, who told me I had signed up for XXXX bonus points not {$200.00}. off and to give me the {$200.00}. off would actually be a downgrade and she could not do that. 

I escalated the complaint to the owner of company in New York. Someone called me on around XX/XX/XXXX to tell me although she XXXX confirm that there was a {$200.00}. off offer in XXXX when I applied for the credit card account, that her position was that when I bought the ticket it was on a URL for XXXX bonus points.

I have my entire browsing history saved. A XXXX search showed similiar bait and switch situations related to JP Morgan Chase Credit Card Services and XXXX flights. JP Morgan Chase accepted no responsibility for their failure to issue a temporary credit card number so I could book the flight that same day.

I explained on the call and the letter i was not in the right frame of mind at the time of the loan and their agents knew it. I was distraught by being behind on a vehicle at time of this purchase. Their agent took advantage of me and put it a worse situation. This company told me at the time of the loan they did not take into consideration the vehicle i had outstanding when it came time for the DTI calculation. I was told they only look at the new loan amount and the gross income. Logically speaking it doesnt make sense to take on a second vehicle with a higher payment than the one i was behind on. This is a predatory lender that has had class action suits against them and i bet there are several people that have the same scenario as me. The prey on people with challenged credit. The want people to default on loans by putting them in unfavorable situations. What I asked for is not unreasonable. So once again. Please purchase the account back and close the loan without selling it again.

"Online and on monthly statement account is informed that a promotional balance is expiring. There are two different promotions being used.

To Whom It May concern : I am disputing your claim of a balance due to Navient by me as annotated in your letter dated XX/XX/XXXX for a student loan that I paid in full on XX/XX/XXXX, over 11 years ago. 

I received this letter XX/XX/XXXX. The letter is dated XX/XX/XXXX. It is postmarked XX/XX/XXXX ( see attachment ). The letter states To pay loans in full, we must receive you payment of {$680.00} within 10 days of this letter. Ten days from the XXXX was XX/XX/XXXX. As I stated earlier your letter arrived on XX/XX/XXXX. This delay was due to 7 days between the date of the letter and the actual postmark on the envelope ( see enclosed ). This lack of timeliness in your correspondence is indicative of the time frame this letter pertains to, a XX/XX/XXXX notice for an account that was paid in full on from XX/XX/XXXX with a payment of {$79000.00}. Please note that according to your enclosed account history it took 2 years to post a {$55.00} adjustment. 

I spoke with customer service representative XXXX on the phone on XX/XX/XXXX. She told me the dates of correspondence forwarded to me from Navient following my final payment posted on XX/XX/XXXX are as follows : 7 months later on XX/XX/XXXX 5 days later on XX/XX/XXXX 6 years and 3 months later dated XX/XX/XXXX 2 months later XX/XX/XXXX 2 years 11 months later XX/XX/XXXX 1 years later on XX/XX/XXXX Once I made my final payment in the exact amount of {$79000.00} any and all correspondence from any company would have been viewed as another lending company looking for business or a solicitation from a credit card company and promptly discarded. Again I point you to the length of time between notices issued by Navient. It is 11 years and 9 months since my payment of {$79000.00} posted on XX/XX/XXXX and your letter dated XX/XX/XXXX. 

Upon asking XXXX how Navient arrived at the {$390.00} principal balance she told me there was an {$80000.00} balance offset by the XX/XX/XXXX posted payment of {$79000.00} payment. Per the enclosed spreadsheet I had made a total of {$82000.00} payments toward principal. 

Upon opening an account with XXXX XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX is when I noticed and submitted a dispute for them to investigate the Navient entry on my credit report. While this is a screen shot from XXXX XXXX and not Navient, ( see PDF ) please note the date of the Navient entry, XX/XX/XXXX. 4 years and almost 11 months before my final payment on XX/XX/XXXX, the date XXXX cited on our phone call on XX/XX/XXXX used to calculate the {$390.00} principal balance. 

Furthermore, I question Navients record keeping, and by extension, making your calculations unreliable, by citing the screen shot below from your web site. It indicates I am supposed to make a monthly payment of {$520.00} due on XX/XX/XXXX! 

We have all been warned of scams and unscrupulous companies attempting to bilk money from unsuspecting people. Upon learning of the ongoing lawsuit by Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and many State Attorney Generals, I am increasingly alarmed that money may have been misapplied on my account. This account appears as an outstanding debt on my credit reports for XXXX and XXXX  and adversely affects my credit rating. 

Given the absence of any written documentation detailing your calculation supporting the {$390.00} principal and XXXX interest balances listed in your notice dated XX/XX/XXXX, the inordinate and inconsistent length of time between supposed documentation ( I was unable to locate any list of notices or documentation on www.navient.com ), poor record keeping ( see Navient screen shot ) I reiterate my refusal to pay {$680.00} to a company that only offers a figure in a letter and a verbal claim by a customer ( albeit courteous ) service representative.

"Comenity Bank is the issuer of a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX store credit card. I paid the recommended amount of {$350.00} or more every single month ( not the minimum payment of approximately {$60.00} ) in order to avoid being charged an accrued interest payment at the end of an 18-month promotion. The last statement makes a note to list the end of the promotion period, which is a mid-month cut off date. But, the MAIN landing page of the credit card website with the ACCOUNT SUMMARY makes no mention of the end of the promotional period. The ACCOUNT SUMMARY portal on the website is where payments are made and where they recommend how much to pay on a monthly basis. The fact that the end of the promotion was not clearly identified in the ACCOUNT SUMMARY section of the website or not identified in the payment portal is very deceptive in my opinion. To my knowledge Commenity made no effort to provide email communication or notification on the main landing page of the website that the promotional period was ending or that a {$980.00} finance charge would be assessed if I did not make one last small payment of {$210.00} in the middle of the month. Further more because it was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX credit card and I only made 2 purchases on that credit card there would be no routine reason to check credit card statements. One of the primary reasons that people check a credit card statement is because the want to verify their purchases and make sure that there are no mistakes in their purchase history. I believe that Comenity is counting on the fact that due to the nature of the store credit card, where people clearly remember what they purchased, that they will not go ahead and read the credit card statement as they would with a traditional ( non store specific ) credit card. Comenity 's belief that consumers will not read the statements is the reason that the notification of the end of the 18-month promotion can only be found on the statement and is not identified in any other way by Comenity bank. 

In short, I believe that Comenity bank acted deceptively and they are unwilling to credit and remove the accrued interest charges.

"On XX/XX/XXXX, I applied to open a checking account with BECU. I currently have a checking account ( and associated debit card ) with XXXX  XXXX XXXX, and have had since XXXX. I planned to use this second checking account ( an interest-bearing account ) primarily as a savings account, with some occasional debit card activity. To my shock and surprise, my BECU checking account application was declined - and I was told that the declination was the result of a low Consumer Score ( XXXX ) I was assigned, as BECU 's minimum acceptable score is XXXX. This low score ( according to BECU ) was being assigned as a result of information provided by an agency known as XXXX. I had never heard of this agency before, but following the instructions provided in the BECU declination letter, that same day I made an online request to XXXX  for a free copy of the exact report/information they had provided BECU. Several days later I received a report from XXXX in the mails, with absolutely no negative, derogatory, or adverse information on it! Confused, I decided to make an appointment with a BECU banking representative ( at the local XXXX  XXXX office ) - I showed him the XXXX  report I had received, and he said he could see nothing that would cause concern, and he even "" looked '' at my XXXX  record from the Credit Unions ' access side - then he said something that caused me a lot of concern - he said he had never seen a record like that - that usually there were notations of NSFs or other adverse activities - but on my record, there was nothing. He then suggested that I contact XXXX, and try to get an explanation from them. That idea proved to be absolutely worthless, as the XXXX rep just told me I could dispute anything on the report - but wait! - what can I do if there's no negative information to dispute?? They also told me I could dispute the previously-assigned score. So I did both those things, but the reports came back with no new information, and the score came back only 3 points higher ( XXXX ). I decided to speak to someone at BECU one more time, to see if perhaps I was overlooking something on the report. I also wanted to try and get some guidance on what my next steps should be. I met with a district branch manager at BECU 's corporate headquarters in XXXX. This proved, once again, to be an exercise in frustration, as she looked over the XXXX report very carefully, but could find nothing of concern. She asked me who I currently banked with, and I told her that I had banked with XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX for the last 10 years. After spending an hour with her, as she looked up terms used on the XXXX  report trying to determine what might be causing the low scoring, the only thing she ended up suggesting is that I go to XXXX XXXX XXXX, and ask them to file a formal dispute with XXXX, as there must be something that they're reporting in error. Of course, she was working under the assumption that XXXX was indeed reporting some misinformation - so my next meeting was with a XXXX branch manager at the XXXX  branch in XXXX  XXXX  ( where I first opened my account back in XXXX ). This meeting also became a frustrating experience, as this manager was insistent that the bank was reporting no derogatory information to XXXX, so she was not able to dispute anything - once again saying that this XXXX  report I had was very unusual. Then she actually told me that I should now seek legal counsel and protection under the consumer protection laws, and file a formal complaint under the FCRA. So, here we areI 've been unfairly denied the opportunity to establish a checking account with BECU because of an unwarranted decision made by BECU ( which BECU says is based on information given to them by XXXX ), and neither XXXX, nor BECU seem to be able to provide me with a verifiable reason that I was not allowed to establish a checking account with BECU at this time.",Checking or savings account,BOEING EMPLOYEES CREDIT UNION,3
"To whom it may concern : Let me start by saying that I am in a uniquely advantageous position related to my student loans. I graduated from XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX and started to pay back my loans in XXXX. I was able to secure a job that provided me the ability to repay my loans at an extraordinary rate. Through the first couple of years I made minimal payments to Nelnet ( my loan servicer ). They processed these payments in a timely manner and I never had a complaint. However, once I started making much larger payments Nelnet was suddenly unable to process these payments and I kept receiving news that my payments did not go through even though they went through the month before with the exact same banking information. So, I would call and explain to their representatives that the banking information has not changed and they would politely inform me that I could retry the payment and all would be forgiven. 

Now, I can understand maybe I made a mistake with the banking information the first time and maybe even the second and third time but when the fourth time did not go through I grew very suspicious. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd time I used their website and plugged in all the information myself. The 4th time I  contacted the representative office and gave them the information over the phone and had them repeat it back to me. Everything finally seemed as if it was going to work out. But then the following week I again received notice that the payment would not go through. 

This is when I started to do my research on Nelnet as company and found out that I am not the only one that seems to be having this issue. There are many people struggling to pay back their loans, and not because they don't have the money to pay but because Nelnet is just refusing to accept their payments. 

The most aggravating part about Nelnet is that they charge interest on the payments that they are refusing to receive. I am not a lawyer but that seems criminal to me. 

Lastly, I would like to reiterate that I am in the unique position and overall this issue has not affected me terribly. However, I think that the majority of people depend on their loan service to be consistent and ethical. Students take out tons of debt to try and better themselves and then are punished for doing so by these firms. Firms like Nelnet are taking advantage of students without consequence and they will continue to do so until they are held accountable for their actions.",Student loan,"Nelnet, Inc.",4

Because I never received the supposedly mailed letter, I did NOT get a chance to dispute the debt which is my legal right. 

Solomon and Solomon has started legal action against me without following the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act which states that : A collector has to send you a written validation notice within five days of first contacting you. The notice has to say : 1 ) how much money you owe 2 ) the name of the creditor you owe it to 3 ) what to do if you dont think its your debt The Act requires debt collectors to do the following ( among other requirements ) : Identify themselves and notify the consumer, in every communication, that the communication is from a debt collector, and in the initial communication that any information obtained will be used to effect collection of the debt [ 30 ] Give the name and address of the original creditor ( company to which the debt was originally payable ) upon the consumer 's written request made within 30 days of receipt of the 1692g notice ; [ 20 ] Notify the consumer of their right to dispute the debt ( Section 809 ), in part or in full, with the debt collector. The 30-day "" 1692g '' notice is required to be sent by debt collectors within five days of the initial communication with the consumer, though in 2006 the definition of "" initial communication '' was amended to exclude "" a formal pleading in a civil action '' for purposes of triggering the 1692g notice, [ 31 ] complicating the matter where the debt collector is an attorney or law firm. The consumer 's receipt of this notice starts the clock running on the 30-day right to demand verification of the debt from the debt collector. [ 20 ] Provide verification of the debt [ 32 ] If a consumer sends a written dispute or request for verification within 30 days of receiving the 1692g notice, then the debt collector must either mail the consumer the requested verification information or cease collection efforts altogether. Such asserted disputes must also be reported by the creditor to any credit bureau that reports the debt. Verification should include at a minimum the amount owed and the name and address of the original creditor. [ 20 ] File a lawsuit in a proper venue If a debt collector chooses to file a lawsuit, it may only be in a place where the consumer lives or signed the contract [ 33 ] Note, however, that this does not prevent the debt collector from being sued in other venues for violating the Act, such as when the consumer moves outside the venue and a letter demanding payment is  forwarded to the new address, even if the debt collector is unaware of such a change in residence.

"I want to thank you for the opportunity to submit this information as I continue my next steps in regards to my home.. I want to ensure this was reported in case others are going through this. I was not aware of this bureau until two weeks ago. I am a service connected Veteran who purchased a VA home loan through USAA a few years ago.I love USAA. I never had any issues with USAA if I did, they were always helpful in resolving them. Ive been a member since XXXX if I can recall. 

XXXX I received a notice from USAA that XXXX XXXX  XXXX a subservicer of USAA was transferring the servicing of my mortgage loan to a new subservicer XXXX  effective. I never knew XXXX was a subservicer of my loan, I've never received any documentation on XXXX or statements. Once the loan was serviced by XXXX I noticed a lot of changes to include escrow statements and I was not happy with their practices even when I questioned my escrow account statements. 

XXXX I had setbacks and I was recovering from a lot of major changes and unexpected circumstances from the prior year and I was working to get things back on track. In the midst of all of this I applied to several jobs and started working, however the income was nothing compared to what I used to make. 

XXXX Refusal to accept Mortgage Payments I was behind on my mortgage 60 days as my income was adjusting. I was sent a notice of being behind from XXXX Subservicer of USAA in addition to a statement of late fees recurring. I was advised I had until XX/XX/XXXX to bring my mortgage current. At that time my mortgage was {$1000.00} per month and I was behind two months. I also received additional letters from XXXX  Servicer of USAA advising me that my home will be set for foreclosure by XXXX XXXX in XXXX, if I did not bring my account current. 

I went online to USAA.com to pay my past due mortgage as I've always done. I was able to login to all of my USAA accounts except my Mortgage account. I called tech support as I thought there was something wrong with my overall login. Tech Support informed me there are no blocks on logging into USAA and I should check with the mortgage company the next day. since were closed since I called in the evening I called XXXX and I was informed that I was not allowed to make any payments online and I was blocked from making payments and my account is set for foreclosure. This is what led me to where I am today unfortunately. I asked the representative how I could bring my account current if I am unable to make a payment online or even over the phone. I was denied. I did not receive any notice stating I would be blocked from making online or over the phone payments. I have made online payments or over the phone payments for years at this time. I even informed them that the notification stated I had until XX/XX/XXXX. I was not allowed to make any payments online, and was completely blocked from my account. I could only view. 

I called XXXX XXXX constantly and they also called asking for payments. I always stated how am I supposed to pay? In addition if I have the money to pay, I do not know how to pay if I am being blocked. This back and forth went on for quite some time. I was appalled and very frustrated. 

Refusal of requests for Loan Modification A month or so went by and my past due increased in addition to lawyer fees piled up. I still could not make a payment online or wasn't advised where my payments could be sent to. By this time I was at {$6000.00} to include lawyer fees for 3 months. I received a statement packet in the mail. In the statement packet I was sent an Uniformed Borrower Assistance Package. I applied and requested for forbearance or loan modification. The first application I was denied. I contacted my local HUD office since I was unfamiliar with the overall process. I was advised to speak to loss mitigation. HUD spoke on my behalf and I was able to apply to get a loan modification as at that time I had a roommate and I am foreign to these documents or process and I did not know I could include them in the initial application. The Veterans Administration was also involved throughout. 

I applied numerous times for a loan modification and was constantly denied. The denial reason was always the same. I appealed every time except the last application.Each time even in less than 30 days my credit was pulled. After the denial I had no other choice but to file bankruptcy to save my home. 

Forbearance Plan, Affordable Modification, & Standard Modification all denied each time due to their response below. 

Due to excessive obligations, we are unable to offer you a modification plan because we are unable to create an affordable payment without changing the terms of your loan beyond the requirements of the program I could not understand why I constantly kept getting denied. I know I was able to afford a loan modification. In addition I informed XXXX that I was going to be receiving extra income soon with one of the jobs I applied for in XXXX. I was still denied all except the options to sell my home which I do not want to do or go into foreclosure. 

The Veteran Administration intervened and assisted tremendously. I can not thank them enough. I was in a situation I never wanted to be in, but life happened for me. I have plenty of emails and conversations with the Veteran Administration, myself and XXXX aka XXXX XXXX. I did not know XXXX was XXXX XXXX until the emails back and forth from the member specialist and the Veteran Administration listed as XXXX XXXX. 

Bankruptcy & Deductions of Reinstatement Amount I filed Bankruptcy I never wanted to file bankruptcy but XXXX did not give me any choice.. In less than 30 days of filing bankruptcy, I paid a total of {$3000.00} to include the first mortgage payment after filing bankruptcy, filing fee and bankruptcy payment. The total lawyer fee was {$5000.00} which was paid in 90 days. My bankruptcy payments were high, almost {$2000.00} each month in addition to my regular bills. I could not understand how I was able to file bankruptcy and not receive an affordable loan modification from XXXX  subservicer of USAA.. During this time I received a statement that my mortgage payment increased from {$960.00} to {$960.00}. 


ESCROW TAXES & INSURANCE ACCOUNT In filing bankruptcy the lawyer questioned the total amount that was past due at filing per XXXX  The amount past due per XXXX  was {$3300.00} less than my last statement from XXXX prior to filing bankruptcy. The lawyer asked me where the payment come from and did I pay that? I advised I did not know. 

Did XXXX used my escrow to pay off part of my reinstatement balance prior to filing bankruptcy?. XXXX also Falsified documents and stated prior to filing the total amount was {$19000.00} which is incorrect. This is also listed on the notice of default to courts which is incorrect. 

My recent Escrow & Interests Statement received XX/XX/XXXX indicates my current mortgage is {$1000.00} which is incorrect. I did not receive any statement that my payment changed from {$960.00} to {$1000.00} My home insurance is not paid through my mortgage payment. I pay this monthly on my own. Where is this insurance money going to? 

XXXX Improper allocation of mortgage payments during bankruptcy to purposely attempt to foreclose and put me in default. 

I received my first informational statement after making my first mortgage payment during bankruptcy as the next month was due in a few weeks. I called XXXX  subservicer of USAA and quickly questioned why my current mortgage payments were listed as unapplied and partial payments. XXXX Subservicer of USAA advised me that all of my current payments that will be made will be going to my past due payments, not current mortgage. I argued that this was incorrect as I pay the trustee my past due payments during my bankruptcy. Any payments that I make directly should be going to my current mortgage so I will not be in default. I requested a corrected statement that states applied.. I never received a corrected statement. 

I contacted my attorney to advise and sent them the information of my first payment. I informed I will not pay twice to past due, as this would cause me to be in default and in more debt. I will not pay until it is corrected and statement indicating my payments made directly will go to current not past due which is in bankruptcy. XXXX  subservicer of USAA filed a notice of default and wanted to foreclose on my home as I suspected they would. My lawyers intervened and both parties agreed that I would pay on top of my current mortgage during bankruptcy an additional amount each month following the next month for the past due. This still was not resolved. This was becoming expensive at the fault of XXXX and I was consistently getting in more debt. I paid my first payment again and the statement was still not corrected. It still listed unapplied and partial. I made my second payment which was split as the additional funds for me came later in the month to pay the additional agreed amount. I paid for two months after the agreement with one late fee.

I met with an attorney to go over my income so far during bankruptcy. .My income increased for about 4 weeks from one of my income sources and I also lost income as my car needed repairs.

I informed my lawyer and expected this information to be relayed to the trustee ; it was not, the lawyer only reported increases from one source of income, which was not permanent, not overall income changes.. Due to  XXXX falsely filing a default letter I did not get an opportunity to go over my changed income in court.

Bankruptcy was becoming expensive. I spoke with one of the attorneys who advised me to let my case be dismissed and start over with this new information. I argued that it would be another {$5000.00} for me to pay when they could resolve this now and report the correct information to the Trustee and judge and lower my bankruptcy payments. 

In order to assist me further, they wanted more money. I refused. My Bankruptcy case was dismissed. They asked me to retain them again, I refused. 

In less than a year Ive paid a total of {$11000.00} to bankruptcy and lawyer fees alone not including my other bills to live. All of this could have gone to my mortgage, but XXXX constantly denied my loan modification and refused to approve my loan modification and correct the total amount due and refused to apply my payments made to my mortgage. This is causing hardship and prejudice to constantly continue to go through this no matter what I do just to manufacture reasons to foreclose on my home. These are deliberately unfair practices. This is also preventing me from getting other opportunities in reference to mortgage assistance which is harmful to my stability. 

XXXX Misleading, Falsifying information, payments court documents, and deceptive practices to attempt to foreclose on my home. 

During bankruptcy XXXX Subservicer filed a notice of default indicating I did not make my first payment after the agreement between XXXX and my attorney. I sent my attorney at the time my bank statements of my payments to prove that I paid as XXXX reported that I did not pay which I did. 

XXXX argued that they will not accept partial payments. Two months later I received a letter from XXXX indicating that funds I paid to my mortgage account prior are in an unapplied account and that I need to pay a total past due of {$24000.00} to reinstate my loan by the 35th day from the notice or my house will go to foreclosure There is a next payment due date of XXXX on this noticed which is completely incorrect. This also includes almost {$7000.00} in fees. This is deceptive practices by choosing to once again not accept my payments even in bankruptcy and allocate my funds to another account to list me in default.",Mortgage,UNITED SERVICES AUTOMOBILE ASSOCIATION,2

"On XX/XX/XXXX I made a complaint against Sallie Mae for refusing to work with me to arrive at a monthly repayment amount that is within my power to pay. The complaint was responded to by them in the form of a telephone call to me suggesting that I do not make the payments due on XX/XX/XXXX ( as there is no possible way I can make the payments and still pay my basic living expenses ) and wait for their collections department to contact me. I was told that at that time, they would make new payment arrangements with me.

"Caliber Home Loans was my mortgage loan servicer until my loan was paid in full XXXX, XXXX, 2020. 

Caliber held the {$5100.00} escrow balance until XX/XX/2020, when, reported by Caliber 's customer service, the {$5100.00} USD check was allegedly mailed with first class postage, no tracking abilities. 

Today, is XXXX XXXX, 2020, and more than 25 non-holidays ( Sat, Sun, etc ), since XX/XX/XXXX, paid in full status of my loan. 

I've called Caliber Home Loans Customer Service and Escalation Department repeatedly to ask about the check. I have repeatedly been informed that is is Caliber 's policy to mail all refunded escrow checks via regular mail and for it to take 10 to 21 business days to receive the check. 

However, when requesting if they could locate the check, I was told they have no way to do that ; however, if I do request the status of the check be submitted the consequence would be the check they mailed would be cancelled and I could not use the check when finally received. 

Additionally, I was informed that the process would begin all over again, including the use of non-traceable mail and first class postage only - A catch 22!

Additionally, I find. it a bit hard to believe that I am the only one being disadvantaged by their delay codified in their Policy as stated by Customer Service and Escalation Department. 

Their delay has cost me more than {$1300.00} on a short term loan that I had reasonably expected to pay by XX/XX/XXXX. I will again have to pay an additional {$1300.00} if their process fails to deliver my escrow by XX/XX/XXXX.",Mortgage,"Caliber Home Loans, Inc.",2
"I want to complain about XXXX XXXX XXXX, servicing by XXXX. This company gives an extremely hard time to customers in order to remove PMI. 

I bought my house in XX/XX/XXXX, by paying 10 % down payment and paying {$100.00} PMI ( mortgage insurance ) each month. In my loan document, it says I could pre-pay more principal anytime to make the loan amount < 80 % of the house purchase price and remove PMI. However, from early this year around XXXX XXXX, I contacted XXXX  to ask about how to do pre-payment of principal and remove PMI but I was told I was not allowed to pre-pay any principal and remove PMI in the first two years! In the summer around XXXX, I called and got the same answer. However, my loan document has NO such rules. 

Finally, XX/XX/XXXX, I found out I COULD pre-pay more principal on the online account and my loan to house value ratio became around 79 %. Immediately I requested online to remove my PMI. Later I called their insurance division and was told it would take them at least 30 days to review my request but later was told they were sure I could not remove PMI because of some government rules but they refused to tell me. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I found on the online account, it wrote : "" The Homeowners Protection of 1998 gives you the right to request the cancellation of the PMI premium that is added to your loan payments. If you do not request cancellation, and you are current on your loan payments, then PMI will terminate automatically : On the date the principal balance of your loan is first scheduled to reach 78 % of the original property value. '' I immediately paid more principal to make the ratio of loan to house price to 77.2 %. However, till now ( 2 weeks later ), the online payment still shows I need to continue to pay the PMI! 

Finally I reached their "" real '' customer service to tell me what happened about PMI. I was told my loan to value ratio was fine now. However, I had to send them a check to pay a fee ( {$100.00} or more depending on the market price ) for a new quick appraisal on my house to make sure my house value did not drop!!! 

Think about how long they want to waste my time to drop PMI!! I will have to mail them a check to pay this appraisal, then they let me schedule the third party to come to do the appraisal which might take another 2 to 4 weeks. After they receive the appraisal report, it will take them another 30 days to remove PMI if they finally say yes. So in total, it will take at least 2 months in order to let me pay the appraisal and remove PMI. At the same time, they continue to charge me PMI!!! 

I have never heard any other loan company to give customers such a hard time to remove PMI with all the lies and delaying the process. 

This is illegal to keep pushing me to pay PMI. Crazy experience.",Mortgage,"LAKEVIEW LOAN SERVICING, LLC",2

My review with XXXX  XXXX XXXX, XXXX  XXXX XXXX, XXXX Hospital, and XXXX XXXX XXXX showed the amount should have been closer to {$10000.00} to {$12000.00} while XXXX XXXX   charged some {$56000.00} per Capio Partners which indicates that XXXX XXXX charged me for more than one patient or willfully and deliberately committed fraud by charging an amount that they knew to exceed what used to be reasonable and customary charges. In addition, XXXX XXXX has been proven to have committed fraud in paying our four top XXXX XXXX executives some {$120.00} XXXX as they sold out to XXXX XXXX, and one of the  selling points was the large "" accounts payable '' on their books. In addition, XXXX XXXX XXXX was established to address the lack of care that XXXX XXXX   provides to XXXX residents as myself as they have eliminated XXXX services and operating theater at the old  XXXX Hospital. In short, XXXX XXXX looted the XXXX Hospital to help fund the pay outs to those four XXXX XXXX executives. Capio has not purchased this alleged debt and they have not disclosed how much their fee would be to collect this debt but as a general practice my research is showing much of the medical debt is being discharged at 32-46 % of the original amounts if they met the XXXX  billing amounts. In short, XXXX XXXX should recalculate my medical charges with a full itemization showing the XXXX  amounts. Capio needs to butt out as they are not medical practioners, they can be linked to fraud as they are attempting to profit from fraud, and they are not permitted to see medical billings per HIPPA.",Debt collection,"Capio Partners, LLC",0

"On numerous of different occasions, I've contacted Bridgecrest formally known as XXXX XXXX about my XXXX XXXX XXXX. Between XXXX- current, I've spoken to several different representatives about how we could get the loan paid off. After speaking with several representatives there they informed me that our maturity date was XX/XX/2019 and we have 90 days after that to get the final payment made to gain ownership of the vehicle. My husband and I worked out a payment plan that fit our budget to get this vehicle paid off. Our final payment date should be no later than XX/XX/2019 from what the last rep provided us with. Not until I received an XXXX alert stating that my credit had been updated with a new alert around mid XXXX is when I begin to worry again. Once I got the alert I contacted the company again asking why was it a mark on our credit? The rep then stated well yes we give you 90 days after the maturity date but every month after XXXX you will have a derogatory mark on your credit and when the final payment is posted it will show paid off in a delinquent status due to not paying it off on the XXXX maturity date. After expressing how frustrated I was with the company and the lack of information being given all they could say is they understand and apologize for no one telling us if the car wasn't paid off by the maturity date it will show late every month for the following 90 days. These lines are supposed to be recorded so us a customers have to suffer with the negative impacts on our credit due to the company employees not telling us what to expect for us not paying it off by the maturity date and using their next option of paying it off within 90 days afterwards. This doesn't impact anyone credit other than my husband and I, this was a very bad business practice and I will never want to do business with them ever again. I'm glad I know this now because I have another veh due to mature early next year and I now know to work to get it paid off before the maturity date and not use the 90 days after that they advertise so they can collect more money and ruin our credit more. We are working to purchase a home and I've told the company this is on several occasions, it's sad how they can treat people and not be held responsible for their actions but they want us to pay on time and penalize us for taking advantage of their 90 day after maturity date pay off option not knowing that this would be reflected on our credit negatively. We've dealt with them over 5 years and this isn't the first time that we have received incorrect or inaccurate information.

I accepted a 12 mo. 0 % promo offer. I unknowingly forfeited my grace period for new purchases. If you make new purchases or are charged any fees ( i.e. renewal ) you WILL be charged your current finance charge IMMEDIATELY once the charge hits your card. It doesn't matter if you pay your statement balance in full each month - you're charged from day 1 for that charge - NO grace period. Seems like a SCAM to me. I am not aware of any other cards that do that. All of the 0 % promos I've had still retain the grace period and you are not charged ANY interest if you pay the minimum amount due each month + any new charges incurred. Thankfully I had the funds to pay the entire balance in full from savings and IMMEDIATELY stopped using the card. Seems like an unfair business practice to me because it's REALLY NOT 0 % if you're IMMEDIATELY being charged an extremely high interest rate for new purchases.,Credit card or prepaid card,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,1
"Hi, I have contacted Ditech twice about my adjustable rate mortgage. During XXXX, my interest rate increased due to rising interest rates. However, this year, interest rates tumbled, but my adjustable rate has not declined. I have phoned Ditech twice. The last time was yesterday.

They do not have a record of my account because it has not transferred yet. 

On the current Ditech website, it appears that my rate will stay the same, 5.25 % and be reset on XX/XX/XXXX for five more months. I feel helpless because Ditech is paralyzed and the new company will not lower my adjustable rate mortgage. In fact, it should have been lower this year, which means Ditech owes me interest money.

Within a week I received a letter which stated the discrepancy between the account names and this must be corrected or the account will be closed and funds issued as a cashier check. Due to some delays and personal family issues I did not react fast enough and the account was closed. They issued the account balance as a cashiers check made out to XXXX XXXX XXXX. I tried to deposit this in another personal account but this was not possible due to the name being made out to my business. I asked XXXX If I update my business name can I deposit the check in the new account and they said no because my account name will not match the cashier check name. So I contacted XXXX and requested they re-open my account under the original name. This was declined because they put a hold on a new account with this name. Finally I was able to go to another branch and ask them to work on fixing this. They made several attempts to re-open the account and asked to have my cashiers check. They shredded it and now when trying to re-open an account I do not have the check. I signed an affidavit that the check was not in my hands anymore.

"What happened : My husband fell and was admitted to the XXXX hospital in XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX, XXXX on XX/XX/2020 They found an impacted hip fracture. That night they asked to put a hold of {$1600.00} on my credit card. The next day they told me they found XXXX  on my husbands XXXX  and that he needed an immediate operation or he would die. At the same time they told me that they needed to put a hold of {$50000.00} on my credit cards - and not to worry that they would not bill until 21 days after giving me an invoice. I found 3 cards - 2 of my husbands and one of mine. They checked the max credit on each card and put a hold of about {$48000.00} across the three credit cards - all from Chase Bank My husband had the operation, was in a XXXX  in the XXXX  for 3 days, and died on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX asked me to return to the hospital the next day to sign some papers. It turned out they wanted to put a hold on another {$40000.00}. I found a XXXX credit card in my husband 's wallet and gave it to them. It had a max credit limit of something over {$19000.00} so they put a hold on that. Each time they put a hold they assured me that they were going to bill the insurance company and would only use the card if the insurance company did not pay. 

I arranged for the funeral in XXXX XXXX, New York. Before I left XXXX XXXX I asked several times for a hospital bill but they said none was ready and I was not to worry. The day I left XXXX XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I got an email from XXXX telling me they had billed all the credit cards but to send them my bank details and they would return the money once the insurance company paid them, I stopped trusting them and did not send the bank details. I have never received a hospital bill. Recently XXXX told me they received a bill for {$130000.00}. They say it is a high dollar amount and will take 60 to 90 days to investigate. I can not see the claim because of privacy rules. 

I called Chase and XXXX from the airport in XXXX and told them the story. They each waited for the charges to go through ( why? ),  closed the cards, categorized the charges as fraud, and reversed the charges. Later on both banks asked if I had given the vendor the credit cards. I said I had and then they both said it was not fraud. ( From the very beginning I told them about giving XXXX the cards for a hold! ) XXXX recategorized my complaint as a billing dispute and is still investigating. Chase put the charges back on new cards and seems very resistant to my requests to further investigate the charges as a billing error dispute. When I tried to speak with a dispute supervisor he kept counting down how long how I had been on the phone so that I couldn't tell him what happened!!! I gave up in tears at 15 minutes. It is now impossible to find anyone to talk to at Chase. I guess due to the Corona virus but XXXX is still providing good support service. I have tried using the convoluted Chase online communication system. I seem to be communicating with computers not humans.

Two of the Chase cards must be paid this week or I will incur large penalties - the two cards have {$43000.00} in XXXX charges. I do not know the situation with the 3rd Chase card because it was in my husband 's name and I can't see it - and I am afraid to ask about it. 

Do I have a valid grievance? My experience with holds has been in hotels where they put a hold on your card when you check in but then give you an invoice that you can review and approve before they actually bill you. I thought an invoice was required. In this case I never got an invoice. The amount billed to each card has nothing to do with services received but rather the max amount of credit available on a particular card. 

Also three of the cards were in my husband 's name. Is it OK to bill the card of someone who is dead? Finally, is it OK to double-bill? In addition to billing my husband and I XXXX has billed in the insurance company.

Re : Contacting XXXX. The following seems to say they were required to bill me by XXXX law - '' The recent changes of fiscal policies in XXXX directly affected bank policies and the prosses of withholding on credit cards.

I received a response in XXXX where FedLoan Servicing failed to certify payments made from XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX that should count toward the requirements for Public Service Loan Forgiveness.

In fact, I consolidated in XX/XX/XXXX. 

They have informed me that in order to correct the error they will have to review these payments manually and can not give me a timeframe for when this review will be complete. They have stated that it can take several months. They can not provide any additional information about steps that have been taken to correct their error. Despite the error occurring during their review, they have consistently blamed the delay and inability to provide more information on response time from previous loan servicers. 
I have asked directly about mechanisms to formally lodge my dissatisfaction and been told that all they can do is flag my account to show that I am not happy with the time it is taking to correct their error. 

I find their inability to accurately review paperwork and correct their errors in a timely manner and their inability to provide useful information regarding the status of a review including any commitment on their part to meet a deadline unacceptable.

"On the date of XX/XX/2019 I stopped by my local branch to make a deposit of {$2400.00} using the ATM inside the building but right outside the door to the main lobby. I decided to use the machine because there was a line inside and I thought it would be quicker and easier. After inserting my debit card I chose the "" deposit cash into checking '' option and laid a set of notes that was half of the first deposit. Even though the sign on the ATM reads that it can take as many as XXXX notes at XXXX time, I split it to avoid any problems with the money being ejected, which has happened before. The total after completion of that deposit was {$1000.00}. 
My second deposit was for my savings account. Again, i separated the bills and inserted what would be {$380.00}. The last and only set of bills that had {$100.00} dollar bills, along with some {$50.00} and {$20.00}, was ejected back out. The machine was running out of time so i opted for extra time to get the money in order, making sure there were no wrinkles or folded corners and the edges were flush and even all around. Then I pushed the deposit cash option again. This time it kept it and I pushed the complete transaction option and got my card and receipt. As I walked to my car, I took a quick glance at the receipt and didn't really notice anything wrong as I got in the car and started driving. It was then that i handed the receipt to my wife so she could take a closer look. As we're going along, she asked me if i had changed my mind about the deposit because it didn't total to {$2400.00}. Since we were almost home by now, I decided i would call the number on my debit card for customer service. After a brief explanation, the person from customer service told me that he would credit the missing {$950.00} dollars back into my account while the investigation department looked into the issue. About two weeks later, I received an email notifying me that the {$950.00} would be removed from my account because their investigation showed that there was no error by the machine. I went to speak with a manager at the branch which, is the only one i've ever used since opening my accounts. After a brief explanation of what happened, she asked me if i was sure that i made a deposit there and if I was sure about the amount. I showed her the receipt, which is also stamped with a code for that particular machine, so now she was sure it was that very ATM. I asked for details about their investigation, what it entails. Do you have a person that unlocks the machine and takes a count of the number of notes and receipts or records of all the transactions on any day. What happens if there is money, like mine, that the machine failed to record, and if it would be there on the date of my transaction, and unaccounted for. She told me that couldn't happen. She then called someone at their headquarters in the investigation department and put me on the phone. Then she asked me if i was sure about using that machine, to which the manager gave her the code stamped on my receipt, showing that I was telling the truth. She then asked if i could have deposited some of the money at that branch and then gone to another branch to deposit the rest. 
Why would i do that! I exclaimed. 
I then asked her, because of all the cameras in the bank and especially the ones on the ATM itself, if they could show me some video of the date and time. She said she would look into it give me an answer in at least 2 weeks or less. I also asked her how they investigate, and she told me that they look through their computer records from their headquarters into that machine and the records it keeps. Two weeks later I was denied. The machine didn't make any mistakes. They did send me some copies of the records showing the transactions I made, but aside from the fact that those records show the timeline being off by two hours according to my receipt, it still did not clarify anything. I believe that since my missing money, along with the waiting period between the deposits, through the machine off and didn't count the {$950.00}, therefore that money was in the machine as extra money.

"XX/XX/2019 REF : COMPLAINT ON CITI ON CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU The incident was initiated in XX/XX/2019 when my brother has the home foreclosure and the family was seeking out the loan to help him. They came to the loan company : XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Alaska XXXX XXXX https : XXXX XX/XX/XXXXXX/XX/XXXX: XXXX XXXX, Director ( XXXX ) Direct line XXXX XXXX, CFO ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX, Senior Account Manager ( XXXX ) This loan company ( XXXX ) got hold of my cards in XX/XX/2019 and claimed that they needed the physical cards to process the loan to the card and transferred to my brothers bank for loan . The credit card on file and the physical cards are the loan requirement. I had never done any business with XXXXloan company before. The loan amount was {$60000.00}. My brother did not receive any loan as promised. 

There was XXXX balance in my CITI Bank card before the XXXX XXXX was using my credit card and made charges. They claimed to load the loan to the credit card by using the card and transferred to the XXXX XXXX for my brother. No loan was received. 

In XXXX, I filed the Fraud claim against XXXX XXXX and they called me back and said that they would not pay for all the credit adjustment if there was a Fraud claim against them. They asked me to close the case and they would not pay. In good faith, I was trying to work with XXXX directly myself. I closed the Fraud claims with 9 credit card banks, including the CITI. I was told that the XXXX would pay for all credit adjustment in XX/XX/2019. It was dishonored. 

I tried to reopen the Fraud claims against the XXXX in XX/XX/2019. CITI however refused the SECOND CHANCE on FRAUD dispute and declined to reopen the claim on my behalf. 

I was bounced between the Fraud and Billing dispute departments. The Fraud declined to take my case as the loan company was given the card info and had the card. I explained to the Fraud team that the card was provided for loading the loan to the card purpose ONLY. Then, I was told to submit all the documents to Billing dispute instead. CITI claimed that I accepted all the transactions as valid in XXXX and they would not reopen the Fraud case even though these are the Fraud charges. The card was given to the loan company for loading the fund and any reason deviated from the original intent was FRAUD. However, CITI FRAUD DEPARTMENT DID NOT LISTEN AND REFUSED FILING ANY FRAUD CLAIM, DENYING THAT IT WAS FRAUD. 
Accordingly, the Billing dispute declined the claim, saying that it should be handled by Fraud team. 

The reason I closed the Fraud claim in XX/XX/2019 as I was trying to work with the loan company in good faith, but the Fraud claim ITSELF WAS VALID. 

It is the FRAUD that the loan company did not honor what they promised and fraudulently charged the {$3300.00} on the CITI credit card, fraudulently claiming that it was for the loan processing for the loan. 

I am seeking that CITI can reverse the fund that was fraudulently charged to my CITI credit card. 

I have filed the Criminal report at the State of Alaska against the XXXX XXXX, police report in XXXX, FBI online, XXXX, Attorney General complaint, NC and Federal Trade Commission, NC. 

Thank you for your meditation in this process and I look forward to hearing from you the positive resolution in this FRAUD CLAIM.

I XXXX   XXXX from Costco then XXXX XXXX XXXX. Since XXXX I have been the number # 1 customer of their XXXX location store # XXXX in illinois if not the whole state, with purchases over {$20.00} XXXX a year from Costco. A couple of years they were even North of {$30.00} XXXX. 
Last month my Costco Citibank visa account was closed without any reason provided. i got the letter in the mail five days after the account was closed. I have made my payments regularly and never been late. When i called the Citibank customer service they did not know why it was closed and told me they were not required to give me a reason. 

My problem with them is if they wanted to close the account, they should have given me at least some transition time so i could arrange for an alternative for my customers till we figure this issue out. They also closed after 11 months of my rebate earned on my account, so that they don't have to pay {$270000.00} they owe me for the whole year. The manager of the location XXXX was very apologetic over it but said it is not in his hands. 
I have emailed the CEO of Costco and Citibank, all i got was a letter from the executive response unit stating i made too many payments on the account in excess of {$9.00} XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX till XX/XX/XXXX. I have to charge the account daily and make payments daily for me to continue to do business. But none of the payments have been late or have bounced. Since when did making payments on the account became an issue. The charges and payments are all electronic. 
I have been doing business the same way since XXXX and they never had an issue before. Even if they did had an issue all they had to do was tell me and i would have adjusted accordingly. They also stated that the rebate earned the whole year is held by them and if they close the account the rebate is forfeited. They don't want to pay my {$270000.00} they owe me in rebate rewards. They paid last year over {$300000.00} with me running the business the same way. 

Upon some research i found out that there are a couple of small companies that Citibank is doing the same thing to. They are listed as follows. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX amount owed {$37000.00} XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX amount owed {$29000.00} Ironically all the owners of the other two companies and me happen to be XXXX. 
There are other XXXX  XXXX with non XXXX owners still operating and using the card the same way we do. 
I want Costco and Citibank to come good on this and reinstate as i have been nothing but an ideal customer with them over past few years, and pay me and the other two people the rebate they owe. Citibank also has an Arbitration clause in their agreement so there is no class action law suit against them. 
I get no answers from Citi customer service. They did not even give me a copy of the signed agreement I signed during initial setup. I am getting no responses or answers from them.

"I payed two mortgage payments in XX/XX/2019. The mortgage company withheld my payments for two months refused to apply them to my mortgage for two months. I payed the current month in XXXX and made sure they released the previous payments to go towards my mortgage. I was told to pay a lessors amount for XXXX payment because I was told their was an overage. I payed the lessor amount. I sent in XXXX payment but the mortgage company sent it back. When I called the mortgage company I was told that they never received XXXX, XXXX, or XXXX payment. I tried again to pay XXXX and XXXX payment but they refused to accept payment. I requested assistance for help. I was told they would send me out a packet. I submitted the packet for assistance. I never received a response back. After reaching out to Loancare about assistance and inquiring about the paperwork I submitted, I was lied to and misinformed about someone working on my file. No one was working on my file. It never happened. I called several more times and was told they needed to submit a hardship letter and pay stubs. I submitted this as well but still no response. Finally I reached out again last week and was told they could not help me because my last modification was less than 24 months ago. Again I tried to make the payments and was told that I had to make four payments. I called back today and was told the same thing basically. I was told that they were aware that I made my XXXX payment but it was put towards escrow not my XXXX payment. Which meant I owed for XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and now XXXX. They refused to take anything less and stated they could not help me. I informed them that I had partial payment but could not pay all four months due to the cut back in hours at work from the Pandemic.

"XX/XX/2020 Wells Fargo declined my online application to open a new checking account, on or about XX/XX/2020. They did not give me an account number or allow me to create an online banking username or password. At the end of collecting extensive personal information from me, they responded that they were unable to approve my account at this time, and would need to "" verify some information '' before they could complete the process. This often happens to me, because I am an immigrant who became a naturalized citizen a decade ago. Banks and others pulling third party data about me often demand to know : "" What state issued your social security number? '' My response to that is : "" How should I know? '' I know I was in my home state when I applied for it, but, because I was a naturalized XXXX Citizen, it was very likely sent to one of several federal processing centers. It is impossible for me to know what state issued my social security number. So I failed that identity challenge question, and from there on out, my chances with Wells Fargo were doomed. 

Predictably, although they said they would contact me, they never contacted me again. They did not phone, email, or mail me anything. My understanding is that this violates my rights to a consumer adverse action notice in connection with my application. 

Then, imagine my surprise when they went ahead and debited ( ahem, stole XXXX {$25.00} from my other banking account at another bank on XX/XX/2020, to fund the account which Wells Fargo had already refused to open. My account was charged {$25.00} and noted "" WELLS FARGO ONL ACHFUNDING. '' I went to their website and it said the online banking system was down. I went to their website at least twice a week for the rest of XX/XX/2020, each time seeing a message that their website was down. 

Today I found out that in reality, they tell all new customers that the website is down, and that they can only use telephone and in-person banking instead, while the site is down. It is critical to note, they do not say "" Because you are a new customer, you can't use online banking yet. '' No, they simply say "" Online banking is temporarily unavailable, but you can access your account at any branch or by phone. '' This wording appears to be intentionally vague, and does not specify that the problem is the newness of the account. Since I was not interested in leaving home during a COVID-19 lockdown, I just waited a few days and tried getting online again. No luck. 

Finally, on XX/XX/2020, I took the time to spend 20 minutes on a phone call to Wells Fargo to ask when their website would be back up, and that's when they finally revealed to me that they were intentionally blocking me from signing in and that they would refuse to provide me my account number. They suggested that I could go to a "" Wells Fargo ATM '' or branch, which is located one state away, in Mississippi. I declined. I advised that all I needed was my account number, so I could provide them the direct deposits necessary to avoid their {$10.00} or $ 12 monthly fee. They refused to provide me my account number. 

They said I would either need to go to an ATM or wait another 5 days then call them back, before they would allow me to create an online banking username or even find out my account number. At this point I was already 30 days into the account opening process, had had none of the previously promised communication from them, and was unwilling to commit another week to the process or to believe their assurances about what would supposedly happen in the future. 

So I asked them to simply return my {$25.00} opening deposit, avoid charging me any fees, and close my account immediately. They refused. They said I would have to either make that request at a branch ( in another state ), or mail them a letter containing my account number and specifying my reason for closing. I re-explained that the whole reason I am closing the account is that they have repeatedly refused to give me my account number. They did not provide it during my application ( which was declined ), and they did not provide it at any time since then. So I asked them to simply provide it over the phone so I could mail them their ridiculous account closure letter. They refused. They further specified that I would be required to not only have the mythical, unobtainable account number on the closure letter request, but that I would also be required to have the letter notarized! I believe they heard a few choice words at that point. 

My desired resolution is that they peform all of the following : 1. Close my account immediately. 
2. Mail me back my entire {$25.00} opening deposit which they took without permission. 
3. Add the note "" sorry '' to my refund check or accompanying apology note. 
4. Do not disclose or sell my personal information to any party. 
5. Do not allow any Wells Fargo employees to access my personal information again in the future, as news reports would indicate there is significant reason not to trust them with that information. 
6. Never contact me again.

"I found out in XX/XX/XXXX while applying to refinance our home that my credit rating was much lower than expected. On XXXX XXXX I called XXXX and discovered a problem with a XXXX credit card issued through XXXX XXXX  for the purchase of about {$80.00} I made in the summer of XXXX in XXXX. I use the card very infrequently. 

I acknowledge the purchase but I never received any monthly statements for payments at either our XXXX  cottage or our main home in XXXX. Not one! We have been to our cottage twice in the fall and winter of XXXX. While mail has been delivered there was absolutely nothing from XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

To resolve the issue I called XXXX XXXX  on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. After a series of calls and delayed/overlapping correspondence from them they finally told me they had no information on my credit card and could not help me since the account had been sold to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX with a balance of {$340.00} and an associated collection agency Stoneleigh Recovery Assoc.

XXXX XXXX  lied to me. After the first call I did not hear anything from XXXX. I called twice more. On the second call they told me the cost of the original balance was {$80.00} and I would be sent a letter verifying that was the amount I owed. On the third call they listened to a recording of the previous call to verify what I was told. In written correspondence they said they would research my claim and would take days to resolve it. They never did this. 

It is clear that XXXX and Stoneleigh did not have our address in XXXX  on record. It was not until I opened the dialogue with XXXX that Soneleigh sent me a letter demanding a deal of a one time payment of {$300.00} for settlement in full against the {$340.00}. Yet they had our XXXX   cottage address. 

In discussions with XXXX  they have failed to provide the alleged missing account statements nor have they provided any information on when and where the account statements were mailed. They have washed their hands of the issue. My credit rating has been levelly damaged. There is no reason I would not have paid this bill on receipt of the statement. 

Stoneleigh claims that mail delivery problems are no excuse. I maintain they never sent any statements. Stoneleigh also said that I should have been aware of the outstanding bill much like a mortgage payment. I maintain that I receive monthly statements from all my accounts and that any normal consumer would reasonably expect such service from XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX.

Incompetency in doubling the hold by withdrawing not {$10000.00} but {$20000.00} from my account and then using the automatic "" overdraft protection '' to overdraw a second account by nearly {$7500.00} only added insult to injury. Those steps effectively deprived us of access to all our cash in the bank for a couple of days. This has been maddening. 

When we get our cash on XX/XX/XXXX, we will immediately open new accounts with a competitor so that SunTrust can not bully us again in the future. Ironically, the merger with BB & T seems to have emboldened SunTrust to run roughshod over even longstanding customers. The new name, Truist, is a complete joke. These folks are proving to be dishonest and unethical in the extreme. My advice is to stay away from this bank.",Checking or savings account,TRUIST FINANCIAL CORPORATION,3

"Updated complaint, prior complaint is XXXX I received the response from Barclay bank, from XXXX XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX. In the response to my complaint there is a statement made that is incorrect. 

The part of his response was : "" On XX/XX/2020, you spoke to one of our representatives who remediated by enrolling your account and scheduled your first payment for {$380.00}, which posted on XX/XX/2020. Also, the representative advised you that once you made your last payment, a settlement completion letter would be sent to you. During that call, the representative read the disclosure, and stated you had the second payment for XX/XX/2020, for {$380.00}, which would complete your settlement. The representative asked if you wanted to schedule the second payment ; but, since you wanted to use a debit card, we advised you that we wouldnt be able too, as it would be applied immediately. The representative advised you there was no second payment scheduled to be debited from your checking account. Also, in your complaint, you stated that you specifically asked that you would not need to call back to make the second payment, unfortunately, we are unable to substantiate your claim. '' I checked the bank that the payment was taken from, and it was NOT taken by card. But rather it was taken as a direct debit, meaning I gave them my account and routing number over the phone when I spoke to the agent. This was the piece of the response that was supposed to address why my payment was potentially mishandled, but in that response there is false information. I did NOT pay by card. I asked if I could pay by card, but when she told me that I could only schedule the one payment by card I then asked to have it a direct debit from my checking account. 

I'm unsure why I still haven't been provided a transcript or recording of the phone call, because as I've dealt with before, I am again not getting a straightforward answer. 

This was regarding a settlement that is now allegedly invalid, which I believe is due to Barclay mishandling the payment. They mishandled the payment the first time I spoke with them, so I don't think it is unreasonable to like proof that they handled my second call to set up payments. I again am requesting a transcript or audio file of the two phone calls, and will not pay anything other than the previous settlement, that I believe is still valid due to their mishandling of my payment. 

I tried to contact XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/20 and today XX/XX/20, but his line goes directly to voicemail. I am NOT content with a pause to payments being the resolution offered, especially since there was false information in the response. I would like for my issue to actually be addressed this time, as I believe the response contained false information, causing me to doubt the validity of the whole response. Again, this could easily be settled by allowing I, the consumer, to be able to hear the recording to substantiate the claims that you are making.

It became clear, very clear, that someone fraudulently obtained these credit cards in our names and used them to make purchases. 
We continuously tried to explain and work with American Express regarding these fraudulent purchases. We were initially told we were NOT responsible for the charges-based on the fact that they sent these credit cards to these thieves, not us. We again made it clear that we NEVER requested, wanted, used these replacement credit cards! 
We acknowledged that SOME charges may be ours and that absolutely we would be responsible for these charges. We asked for detailed Billings from the inception of the credit cards to the current date. We only received partial information. 
To date we have NEVER received a complete report of charges. Now American Express is trying to take us to court to pay for charges that were made fraudulently!! This has been and is extremely upsetting and frightening! Our credit has been severely damaged. We feel that we have no rights, no protection against American Express.

"I requested and received from Chase Bank an e-mail with a code for a {$600.00} sign-up bonus for new customers. I received this e-mail on XX/XX/2019 at XXXX XXXX to my personal e-mail address. This e-mail is shown as Figure 1. I followed the steps exactly as shown on the e-mail and clicked the blue Open an account button with the fine print which reads, Coupon code automatically applied. Once I opened the account I set up direct deposit and deposited the qualifying amount of new money as described. I followed up three months later and was told I never entered the code, much to my dismay since the coupon code should have been automatically applied. 

Anyway, fast forward to today and through numerous calls with Chase customer Service and Research Department staff, too many to recount here, Chase Research Department staff XXXX ( Contact XXXX extension XXXX ) finally got back to me with the unfortunate news. On XX/XX/2019 at XXXX XXXX and lasting 17 minutes, XXXX began to inform me that the XXXX researching my case ( whom I was not able to speak to ) stated that the customer ( myself ) had not applied a coupon code nor navigated to Chase offer page around the time of account opening. I explained to her that I did not need to do any of that because the email stated that the coupon code was automatically applied! I was notably upset, and she refused to assist in any other way other than insisting there was nothing more she could do. In addition, there was no way I could forward to the Chase Researchers any documents to make my case. In addition, they would NOT provide me with the reasoning in writing as their findings. They stated that, and Im quoting, the research findings are internal documents. This feels like a financial institution not wanting to keep auditable and legal documents available. Chase needs to release these documents, fix their email promotion system and award me with the {$600.00}. I am looking for the CFPB ( Consumer Financial Protections Bureau ) or the OCC ( Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ) to assist in this manner. 

And, on a more basic human level, does it even matter technically what happened? If the email link broke and there was some sort of technical glitch, I am a new Chase customer that followed every step of the terms of the promotion, just a few days after a promotional code was emailed directly to my very active, main personal email account. It just seems utterly ridiculous that Chase would refuse to honor this and the way I was treated and the service I received is unbecoming of such a large national institution.",Checking or savings account,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,3
"My name is XXXX XXXX and I am the owner of XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, New York. On this date being XX/XX/XXXX, this letter serves as a formal complaint against Rushmore Loan Management Services. Mortgage Account No # being XXXX. My complaint stems from a violation of RESPA Section1024.41 ( c ) ( 2 ) ( iii ) and 1024.41 b ( ii ) I am citing the following : A. Wrongfully Foreclosing B. Refusing to Offer any Loss Mitigation Options, if the Loss Mitigation Application was Incomplete 1. Wrongfully Foreclosing : First, I have applied for Loss Mitigation and have provided the Servicer with all documents/statements in order to approve Loss Mitigation Application. The Servicer has failed to evaluate documents for Loss Mitigation by requesting documents that had been previously submitted and insurance that had been previously placed by the Servicer since XX/XX/XXXX. 

Second, The Servicer provided a Notice of Intent to Foreclose dated XX/XX/XXXX less than 30 days of requesting additional documents. The Servicer is requesting {$1000.00} to cure the default by XX/XX/XXXX, or commence with foreclosure proceedings. Timeframe provided on Servicers response letter for Loss Mitigation Application dated XX/XX/XXXX, does not clearly specify the requested document deadline. 


Third, I have paid my mortgage in the amount of {$280.00} since XX/XX/XXXX the time period in which the Servicer had received the account from XXXX XXXX XXXX. I had received a modification with XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. In or around XX/XX/XXXX payment increased to {$380.00} and subsequent payments of {$350.00} commencing in XX/XX/XXXX. I have paid mortgage payments in the amount of {$350.00}, since XX/XX/XXXX. 

The Servicer did not honor XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX attempt to approve /execute a feasible Loss and Mitigation Plan. Instead, The Servicer imposed any/all outstanding debts on the property to the borrower which was presumably to be paid by XXXX XXXX XXXX upon receiving the approved Loss Mitigation Plan. If there were any outstanding debts owed on the property, it was no-fault on the borrower to have monthly payments increase. The Servicers actions to ignore borrowers concerns in past CFPB Complaints in this regard resulted in this current collection of debt process. 

2. Refusing to Offer Any Loss Mitigation Options, if the Loss Mitigation Application was Incomplete : First, the lender provided a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, Servicer requested additional documents for determination for Loss Mitigation. The Servicer requested the following : a ) Three month Profit and Loss Statement b ) Proof of Insurance c ) Recent 3-month bank statements Second, the Servicer never provided any short-term payment forbearance program or a short-term repayment plan based upon an evaluation of an incomplete loss mitigation application. 

Closing Remarks : As noted in my provided Hardship Letter, the Servicer is well aware of my past XXXX which has impacted my life in general. Complications of the XXXX had been ongoing. I may be physically fit to carry routine duties one day and the next day maybe in the emergency room. I have medical bills that I am liable for out of pocket. 

I have managed to consistently provide mortgage payments in the amount of {$350.00}, although I do not agree as to how my initial Loss and Mitigation Plan was completely disregarded by your institution for mortgage service errors made by the previous Servicer. Therefore why should I require any monies down towards an approved Loss and Mitigation Plan? 

I believe that I have substantiated the Loss and Mitigation qualification process. I have provided all documentation only to resubmit the same information. In addition, I have been consistently making mortgage payments which consist of property debts from city and county municipalities. This would also include payments for insurance the Servicer placed on the property, since XX/XX/XXXX. Why should have to pay for additional insurance that I am currently receiving from the Servicer? 

If the Servicer believes that I have not fulfilled the Loss and Mitigation process, why have I not received a denial letter and/or helpful options from the Servicer? Although XXXX has its contractual agreements as the Servicer previously provided, they have offered forbearances and is aware they must adhere to certain laws that protect borrowers as well. 

The Servicer is aware of my hardship, but requests {$1000.00} in less than 3 weeks to cure a default. The Servicers action with the intent to foreclose, if monies are not received by XX/XX/XXXX will automatically result in loss of the property. I am seeking a fair lawful opportunity to gain an approved Loss and Mitigation permanent plan.

I was told this program would allow me access to coaches who would guide me step by step on the process that I should take in order to be successful at real estate investing. The representative asked me about my credit cards and their balances, I only had {$16000.00} left on my credit cards. The representative told me which cards to use and how much to put on each card. He said I had nothing to lose and everything to gain. He said my real estate profits would cover my credit card payments and when I started making money, I could pay the remaining {$10000.00}. I put {$4500.00} of the {$16000.00} on my Barclay XXXX card.

"My mortgage loan was sold to this company during the XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/2018 timeframe. I was notified of the transfer and told that SN Servicing Corp would officially take over as of XX/XX/2018. 

During the transfer process, I was immediately confused as to when my next payment was due because I was already informed that money was still being processed from the old servicer ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ). In XX/XX/2018, there were 3 payments made : one from XXXX XXXX XXXX ( {$920.00} ), one from me ( {$870.00} ) and one from Rushmore Loan Services for ( {$460.00} ). I even  called/emailed the company for clarification - never received a response to my email and was given misleading information during the phone call. 

Technically, this should have been payments for both XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, however, only one payment was created ( posted ) in timely fashion and ultimately when I made my next payment in XX/XX/XXXX for the amount of {$870.00}, this was incorrectly considered a "" late '' payment for XX/XX/2018, when it should have been an on time payment for XX/XX/2018. 

Needless to say, I am convinced that much of my account history with SN Servicing is flawed, resulting in a cascading effect on my history.

I am concerned because they have a D- Rating with the XX/XX/XXXX and have several complaints filed against them for similar claims, most of which involve fraudulent activity with their servicing of loans.

Discover Financial Services has been reporting incorrect information to the credit bureaus. I paid this accunt several years ago and they are reporting a recent last payment date. Also, they have failed to provide me with an answer to my letter sent back on XX/XX/XXXX. They did not listen to my demand and the did not even acknowledge my time spent in sending this correspondance to them. 

They are being Unfair and Negligent. They are also committing violations to the section ( 609 ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act by reporting false and erroneous information. This is affecting me physically and mentally and I want a fair solution to this issue. 

I am demanding a deletion letter from Discover Financial Services and I want them to stop collection activity on this account that is already closed and paid. If they dont provide me with the deletion letter that I an demanding, I will not hessitate taking this to a court so a judge decides. I am sure that when I sat down with my attorneys the list of violations will go up. 

Thanks to whomever reads my complaint.

XXXX told them they had what they needed. Only them did they move the process along. They gave me a trial arrAngement. I made the three consecutive payments. They sent paperwork for loan modification that had to be notarized. I completed the paperwork. They said the notarized signature was incomplete. Back and forth we went. I finally spoke to someone there and they said I was all set. The paperwork was accepted. My new loan would begin XX/XX/XXXX. This was near the end of XXXX. I received a call from the mortgager saying I needed to pay XXXX. I said my new loan begins in XXXX. They said I should pay it anyway. When I asked why, they said they didnt know. Its what they are told to say. On the signed agreement, it says to pay your monthly until the new loan is accepted. I was told it was accepted. I signed and had it notarized. It was a legal document. Nervous, and not trusting the company in the slightest, I called at the end of the month to get a clarification. The new loan was based on the balance due. If I made another payment between the time it was calculated, and the time the new loan began, it would change the balance due, this making the calculation moot. But I called anyway. I was put on hold, and I have the screenshots to prove it ... for HOURS!!!! 3 hours and 42 minutes before the call was disconnected on their end. I couldnt have paid if I wanted to. Again, they had blocked me. The next day, XX/XX/XXXX, of course I got right through. They said that since I missed a payment I had to reapply. I argued that the loan was set. After speaking with the fourth person, I was told straight out that the loan isnt accepted until its filed with the court, and that they usually file as late as possible. I was also told that the customer service reps are FORBIDDEN to disclose this. So instead of someone saying just shut up and pay when you are certain the loan has been accepted, and in fact told it was accepted ... they could have said it isnt filed yet and FHA requires you to keep paying until its officially filed with the court.

"XX/XX/2019 This occurrence began at approximately XXXX XXXX  E.S.T. 
( I was on the call with Chase for 39 minutes. ) I had logged into my Chase Account to review my account and saw a "" Flag '' at the top of the page. It was a notification, of a Chase Slate Prequalified Balance Transfer Offer with {$0.00} Fee & 0 % Interest for 15 months, the amount allowed for the balance transfer was {$15000.00}. 

I entered the Account Number and the {$15000.00} allowed to Transfer. 

I submitted the Balance Transfer info and received a pop up window that quickly disappeared. I did catch a glimpse of statement "" Current available balance of $ 3,000+ ''. 

I didn't understand what this meant. 

I tried to find the info for the pop up window again, for a detailed explanation, thinking I had $ 3,000+ more available, in addition to my {$15000.00} balance transfer that I had entered on the application. 

I could not find the info on the Chase website. There was no additional account to view. 

I called the customer service number on the back of my Chase Freedom Card hoping to clarify the $ 3,000+ available balance & confirmation of {$15000.00} balance transfer. 

I reached an agent and did not feel they understood what I was asking. Initially was told no Chase Slate account was found and then later told a Slate account was showing with an available credit of {$3000.00}. I asked about the card balance and was told no balance. I asked what happened to the {$15000.00} Balance transfer entered on the application. The agent told me there was no balance transfer requests on file. I did not feel the agent understood my concern and asked if she was an Offshore agent because of her English usage/accent and she confirmed this. 

I explained I would call back in the am, during normal business hours, to speak to someone else for help because I completed the {$15000.00} Balance Transfer Offer and did not understand why the account was opened for less than ( expected ) the limit given to me with the Prequalified Balance Transfer offer. 

The agent offered to transfer me to an Onshore agent. I accepted & spoke to XXXX. 

I explained, I had been checking my accounts to see what accounts had the higher interest rates so I could prioritize my payoff amounts towards Higher interest rates first when I noticed an offer in my ( Flag ) Inbox for Prequalified Balance Transfer with {$0.00} Fee & 0 % Interest for 15 months. I  applied for this and entered the Account Number and the amount I needed for the Balance Transfer. I submitted the Balance Transfer and again explained receiving a pop up box with confusing info and immediately called Chase when I could not find what I was looking for and that I had been told by the previous agent that the available amount was much less than the application approved amount. 

I explained, if I had known that my request of {$15000.00} was not going to be allowed. I would not have went forward with a partial Balance Transfer. XXXX repeatedly stated I applied for a credit card and they do not have a Balance Transfer Application. I restated the Prequalified Balance Transfer Offer for "" 0 '' fees and {$15000.00} was allowed amount. The advertisement was misleading and false. I expected the {$15000.00} to be transferred as entered on the Balance Transfer Application, the terms given in the offer. I did not authorize a partial offer account. 

I explained : If I went to a bank to request a loan for {$15000.00} and they ran my credit, then told, "" I'm sorry we can't give you the {$15000.00} you requested, we can only give you "" {$3000.00} ''. I would not have proceeded with the account, I would not have opened an account because it did not meet my need/expectation ( As Advertised ). I explained again, I was not told or informed that my request for {$15000.00} was declined. 

I was not given the opportunity to decline the account offer, after they ran my credit, and determined I did not qualify for my requested/needed amount. 

I feel the account was opened erroneously and I requested the account to be voided. I did not authorize the account for less than I requested. 

XXXX, the agent, repeatedly told me the transaction could not be voided. He said the credit inquiry would appear and stand with the credit bureau and the Opening and closing of the account would also appear on my Credit Report. 

I again expressed the Preapproved Balance Transfer Offer for {$15000.00} was false advertising and misleading. 

I attempted to find the offer in My Chase Account but was unable to find anything. 

I told XXXX the same as I had explained to the previous agent, I would call back in the morning to speak to someone in the office & XXXX said it would not matter, when I I called or who I spoke to, because they are there 24/7 and the entry for a Credit Inquiry, as well as the entries on my Credit report for opening and closing an account would stand. He said they are required by law to inform the Credit Bureau. 

I asked : ****Why are they not required to inform me, as a consumer, that my request for a specific amount was denied and allow me to make the decision on whether I want to proceed with the service with only part of what I expected. **** I directed him to leave the account alone as I did not want the additional entries on my Credit Report, I will call the Chase office tomorrow, during normal business hours, to speak to someone else and file a complaint. 

I could've waited to allow today 's account payoffs to post to the Creditors, as well as the Credit Bureau, and come back if I wanted to try again and most likely be approved for the amount I was seeking. 

1. This account should not have been opened for less than I expected from Balance Transfer Application.

a ) I should have been informed the amount entered was denied and given the opportunity to walk away and not proceed.

2. The account should have been voided when I called in and discovered the Balance Transfer was not approved.

3. My credit report should not be affected by the unauthorized opening of a inadequate account.

I understand about Credit Inquiry entries for Credit Bureau.

I Do Not Understand or agree with the Chase Slate account being opened without my informed decision and as a result my credit report should not have the additional open/close entries.",Credit card or prepaid card,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,1

"We set up homeowner 's insurance through USAA on our new home in XX/XX/XXXX via phone with a representative. After calling back multiple times, speaking with multiple representatives due to the premium seeming high, we finally set it up because we trusted USAA.

Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX, upon refinancing our home, it was brought to our attention our insurance premium seemed very high. We went to another insurance agency for a quote, with the same coverages, and were quoted a significantly lower rate -- - because the dwelling coverage on our USAA policy was literally double what it needed to be. When I called USAA to cancel our policy, the representative informed me of the same- that our dwelling coverage was way too high, and that she could get us a lower rate than what we'd been paying. She also informed us a letter had been sent out informing us that our dwelling coverage should have been lower per the USAA appointed inspection report and that this letter was emailed to us on XX/XX/XXXX. I looked through all of our emails and documents on USAA.COM, but this letter she spoke of was absolutely nowhere to be found. Therefore, I requested a refund for what we had been overpaying for 15 months, as we were never notified or provided the opportunity to lower our coverage based upon the inspector recommendation/findings. The representative stated she would forward the request to her manager and get back to me the next day. Unfortunately, the representative got back to me and essentially stated that we would not be receiving a refund because it was our fault the premium was made too high in the first place and maintained that the letter was sent out to my husband 's email, even though there is no record of this letter anywhere else. We were never informed of the findings of the USAA appointed inspection and therefore it was unbeknown to us that we even had an option to lower our premium.

I have set up auto bill pay with XXXX  XXXX XXXX so every XX/XX/XXXX of the month, the card is paid. 
About 20 months ago, I experienced the same issue. They charged me for a bill past due. 
The interesting part is that i had been paying $ XXXX/month without any purchase. They went into my account and cut me a refund check that never arrived, about {$1500.00}.

"I purchased a vehicle and was financed through Santander Consumer USA. I was happy with the loan and the vehicle until the vehicle was totaled in XX/XX/2019, The majority of the loan was paid off quickly by my insurance company leaving a balance of my loan of {$700.00}. I was pleased to know that my gap insurance was going to pay off the remaining balance to Santander consumer USA and would be resolved. Unfortunately the gap insurance took longer then expected. I became extremely nervous about Santander reporting late payments to my credit or charging me late fees as i am in the process of purchasing my first home. I called weekly and spoke to a representative at Santander to make sure none of this was going to occur. Every time they assured me because they where aware of the situation and i was keeping them informed this would not happen. I called them for the last time after my gap insurance had finally paid off the loan to ensure my account was still in good standing and i would receive a payoff notice. This is the first time after over ten phone calls throughout the course of the process that they stated it WAS TOO LATE! I was informed that my credit had been hit with a over 60 day past due payment and was mortified. I explained to the rep i was told several times this would not occur due to the circumstances. She stated there was nothing she could do. I Asked for a supervisor which proceeded to tell me after it hits my credit there is no way he could reverse it. I was in tears as i saw my credit i had been working on go from a promising XXXX down to a XXXX. Due to this incident i was unable to make the offer on my home. I am confident there staff is trained to tell customers that there account is in good standing until it is too late in order to receive the late fees and make sure customers stay further in dept with there company.

"See original complaint : AIH Recievables has been calling my father 's office phone, his company phone and his cellphone repeatedly. They are only allowed to call once, and they continue to call several times a week. I don't know if they ever sent a written notice of any debt, because I am not sure what debt this could be in reference to. This is incredibly hard on my father and his company. It is a smaller, start-up type company and they really don't have time to deal with constant, harassing calls. I believe they have violated the FDCPA, due to : the harassing nature of the calls ( over 10 calls made to his office ), the fact that they have repeatedly tried to contact a third party, and because I NEVER provided any number related to my father on my medical accounts. Please let me know how I can move forward in submitting these violations, as this has been very annoying for my father, and myself. 


I originally submitted this complaint and AIH came back saying I was lying despite the fact I have the call logs to prove this. They sent a snarky message back. Here was my response, which I am sure they have ignored : Their claims are wildly inaccurate. They called a place I haven't worked at for SIX years. Again, this is a startup type company that is incredibly reliant on keeping the lines open for actually relevant calls. They called over 10 times and I would gladly pull the receipts on those calls if this complaint can move forward. They clearly called this place multiple times without a response, which is against the law, especially considering NOTHING on my account that was supposedly forwarded to them listed that place of employment or that phone number. They went fishing for a relative, found one, and harassed them. 

AIH is in violation of the FDCPA and they should be reprimanded for doing so. Their harassing way of action and lack of understanding of who they can contact and how many calls they may make is egregious and damaging to my father 's business.",Debt collection,AIH Receivables Management Inc.,0

Secondly, I wanted the account closed, and it was never closed. Finally, the bank continued to charge my account fees and overdraft based on those fees. I did not charge anything nor was anything charged to my account other than the maintenance fees imposed by Flagstar.

"I opened up my account with Citi in XXXX, a few years later, roughly XXXX or XXXX closed it and stopped using their card and in fact destroyed the card itself. My balance was probably around {$5000.00} or so at the time. So I have been making payments for 16 years. I am using terms like 'probably ' or 'roughly ' because I do not have access to my account. In fact I found out many years later that since I closed my account they took away my 'login ' credentials! 
More importantly, I had opted to receive my statements electronically from the beginning. So the company knew, or certainly should have know that when they XXXX my 'logging into my account ' ability, I had no way of seeing details of my account nor any transactions, change in interest rate or anything at all. They would simply send me an email, since I had opted paperless and in the email always instructed to log in to see details! Over the years, I called and complained about it and they always said : "" since my account was closed, for security reasons I could not have it activated ''. 
I lived with this situation for many years and I had setup my bank account 's bill payment service to automatically pay every month. So far so good. 
It was early XXXX that, because of some financial hardship, I reduced my automatic payment amount from roughly {$80.00}, which I knew was way more than the required minimum to {$40.00}, which I thought would meet the required minimum. I did not have the exact amount since I could not look it up. 
It turned out to be about {$5.00} short of minimum. I had walked into their trap. 
They, without notifying me, set the {$40.00} aside and counted that month as no payment. Added a late fee of about {$45.00} to it and jacked up the interest rate on my account to maximum possible. And this snowballed even though I never missed a payment. In fact my monthly payment would go directly to their late fees and not to principle, and they kept adding more late fees and the max interest. I was living overseas at the time and despite the time difference and costly phone calls they would not answer my questions since I did not have my account number that I had stopped using and did not have the card for some 12 or 13 years. They never did provide me with my account number and I found out what it is when I requested my credit report from the triple reporting agencies. 
All this could have been avoided if they would have kept my online access or switched my statements back to paper when they closed my online access. But then they would not have gotten roughly {$500.00} 'ADDITIONAL ' of my hard earned money. At the time of all this my balance was around {$2100.00} or so. 
How could they disable one 's online access to his own account, knowing that it is the only way I can see my account detail since I have opted 'paperless ' billing many years ago. And how could that have been security risk for me to access my own live, balance running account.

After speaking with him for well over XXXX hours, he told me he was aware of this "" rule '' but based on the transactions that was submitted to the Chase fraud department, he didnt understand why they went all the way back to XXXX of XXXX, when the ledger submitted to Chase started with the first transaction in XX/XX/XXXX, which would have been within the 60 day rule that the fraud department was referring to. 

Well after getting nowhere with the fraud department, i was told by the branch manager to contact XXXX to make sure that they was aware of the fraud. I told the manager i have already called XXXX, but have not heard anything back from them. I told the manager that i will contact them again since they gave me a case number regarding the dispute. After waiting over an hour to get them on the line, and after hours of trying to get a direct answer from XXXX, they finally told me that they determined that the transactions were fraudulently taken from my Chase account and used by a person overseas XXXX  account. They also told me that they closed that persons account and reversed those funds back to the my Chase account. I called back the branch manager at the bank and let him know what i was told by XXXX, and he said that i should see the funds back on the account in about a week at the latest. 

Weeks have gone by and i did not see any funds returned back except the {$37.00} mentioned earlier. I called the branch manager back again to see what the status was, and he called his team and told me he does not see any funds reversed back from XXXX. So after days of going back and forth with XXXX and Chase, i finally got them both on the line at the same time so they could speak with each other to fix this. XXXX confirmed with Chase that the funds were indeed fraudulent and that they confirmed that the funds were sent back to the account. This was in early XXXX i had this call with both of them on the line. 

It is now XX/XX/XXXX. After multiple calls to Chase and XXXX, i have not received my funds back from Chase bank and i have also stop hearing from the branch manager. I called today and finally got him to take my call. He mentioned that he was still waiting on the fraud team on his end.

Either bank of america is doing it intentionally ( to get late fees or interests from the customers ) OR they have shortage of right talent ( who can think, design and implement it ).

"I just submitted a complaint against American Express Macy 's Credit Card, which is Department Stores National Bank. The previous Complaint did not address any of my concerns, and a new issue has come up as of last night. I am hereby filing a new and supplemental complaint against American Express Macy 's Credit Card, which is Department Stores National Bank. 

Curious how Macy 's seems to be affected by Covid only when it comes to responding to their client 's concerns, but have no problem selling their retail. And they show little regard to their customers of almost forty ( 40 ) years, as in my case. 

I am a XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, and I have been addressing consumer grievances for many years. Covid has not kept me from continuing to assist the good people of California as they need a consumer agency which is there for them. 

Their response from their employee, XXXX XXXX Macy 's Executive Office XXXX Extension XXXX was a non-response. In fact, it was hurtful by how non-humane her response was. 

Her response was limited to a spreadsheet of the credits made. I did not ask for, nor did I need a recap of what has and has not been credited by Macy 's. I have access to online activity. Recapping the online activity which I have access to, did not address any of my concerns and did not offer any solutions. 

Asking me to call another Department ( the Executive Office for Macys.com order department for further assistance who can be reached by calling XXXX ), was discourteous and dismissive, and appeared was a boiler-plate response. 

If she needed more information on the items returned, adjustments requested and dirty underwear   delivered to me by them, Macy 's has multiple emails from me regarding these various issues which she has access to, As with anything else pertaining to my account. 

Ms. XXXX not only did not address the issues, she did not even at minimum, forward my grievance to the Executive Office, to have THEM address my concerns with courtesy, and have them resolve my issues. 

Regarding the new health risk issue which occurred yesterday. Macy 's delivered a set of earphones which had also been previously sold as new ( as with previous items noted by me, but not addressed by Ms. XXXX ). The earphone package had been opened, used and re-packaged, delivered incomplete and sold as new. The earphone is equipment which is placed in a human ear. This time, Macy 's outdid itself. A pair of earphones trumps used underwear. 

Hence, my issues remain unresolved. I still have not received credit for previously returned items, and one of those items includes a XXXX  watch for {$120.00}, I was credited {$10.00} for an item which I paid {$53.00}, are only a few examples of what I have written directly to Macy 's about. 

I also have not received price adjustments which have been requested several times. 

But what is worse, Macy 's has not addressed the used underwear issue and now, they are sending used earphones to their clients, such as the ones delivered to me yesterday. 

CFPB, do I need to report Macy 's to the CDC? To the Department of Labor, to the State Attorney, the FTC? 

Help us please. Which agency regulates their behavior during Covid and their irresponsible acts, such as delivering used underwear and used earphones to their clients. 

What exactly is Macy 's obligation not only to you, as a Federal Consumer Protection Agency Regulator, in addressing complaints, but also to me, the consumer? Because they did not address my concerns. And seem completely unaffected by your involvement.",Credit card or prepaid card,"CITIBANK, N.A.",1

"I had a Chase Southwest Rapid Rewards Visa Credit Card issued through Chase. I tried to work this situation out with Chase but got no resolution. I was charged the annual fee of {$69.00} before it was due. They are supposed to credit me back my {$69.00} as I cancelled the card today before the deadline of XX/XX/2020. They acknowledge that I cancelled in a timely manner and that they owe me the {$69.00}. I have a {$47.00} balance on the card that is due in XXXX of 2020. Chase owes me more money back than I owe them. Chase expects me to timely pay my Chase Credit Card for the {$47.00} balance or Chase will go after my credit. I was told by a representative of Chase that I will have to wait six months to automatically get my {$69.00} back. Also, they put the burden on me, the consumer, to keep calling them back if I want my money any sooner than six months but Chase does not say when I should call back.. However, it did not take Chase six months to charge my Credit Card the {$69.00}. I do not understand why it takes Chase six months to give me my {$69.00} back. It is not being returned to me, the consumer, in a timely manner after I cancelled the card. Also, it is not the {$69.00} amount owed it is the principal and fairness of the matter. I am sure Chase does this to every consumer who cancels their card because of they have decided they do not want to keep the card and incur the $ XXXX  yearly fee. I believe Chase does this so they can keep money that is not theirs, for an unreasonable and extraordinary period of time, so they make interest off of each of the {$69.00} amounts. That is a lot of money when you add up all the consumers Chase does this to. 

I know Chase has the physical ability to credit an account immediately. When you call a credit card company and want to dispute a charge they automatically credit the account for the amount disputed. This credit is on the account until the dispute is resolved one way or the other with the merchant. When the merchant making the charge/fee to the account is Chase it leaves the consumer, in this case me, with no recourse except to file a complaint with a Federal Agency. 

Chase requires their consumers to timely pay their credit card bill or be charged fees and interest. However, when Chase owes a consumer money, the {$69.00} in this case, Chase keeps and uses that {$69.00} without the consumer 's permission. Chase then takes six months to pay the {$69.00} back.

XXXX XXXX maintains that I signed a contract and that they provided a 3rd party mover but the mover they provided tried to extort me for {$9000.00}! 

I originally based my dispute on the fact that I tried to cancel the job after the demand for {$9000.00} but after speaking with a fellow named XXXX in the Citi disputes department he advised that I would not win the dispute unless I resubmitted my dispute paperwork as no services rendered, so I resubmitted the paperwork as advised. 

The Citi dispute department has sided with XXXX XXXX for both of my disputes ( see attached dispute letter ) based on the fact that a contract was signed. They claim that they are bound by the Federal Credit Card Act and that only my original dispute can be investigated and they can not reverse the credit card charges because a contract was signed. 

I took my grievance to the Citi CEO 's office ( see attached ) but the outcome was the same, the contract took precedence over all else. 

However, I was in contact with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and they gave me a list of moving brokers responsibilities and the broker was in violation of the following- They did not provide me with the FMCSA Rights and Responsibilities Booklet or the Ready to Move brochure. 
They did not provide me with a list of moving companies they use. 
They did not furnish a written agreement with the 3rd party mover they used ( the 3rd party mover told me they have nothing to do with XXXX XXXX ). 
The mover must perform a physical survey if within 50 miles of the location, they did not. The only survey performed was when they showed up on the move day demanding {$9000.00}! 
Based on theses violations of the broker 's responsibilities I contend that the broker voided the contract. However, Citi still sides with the broker and maintains that unless the broker agrees to a refund there is nothing they can do. Since XXXX XXXX is obviously a corrupt company, they have no intention of agreeing to a refund. 

This is not fair that a company that did nothing but arrange for a group of extortionists to arrive at my apartment demanding {$9000.00} can be allowed to keep {$3100.00} because a fraudulent contract was signed. How can Citi side with this broker after seeing that the original estimate went from {$3900.00} to {$9000.00}!

"Summary Points : 1. Navient ( student loan servicer ) provided me with erroneous information on multiple occasions indicating that I was not eligible for public service loan forgiveness ( PSLF ) ; 2. Based on the incorrect information I received from Navient, I did not pursue PSLF ; 3. I subsequently discovered Navient provided me with misinformation and that I am in fact eligible for the PSLF program ; 4. I have made 47 ( totaling nearly $ 35K ) payments on my student loans while employed by an PSLF-eligible employer, but only 9 payments have counted towards ( please see attached payment history and employment verification forms ) PSLF program goal of 120 payments. This is because Navient gave me erroneous information, steering me into a PSLF-ineligible payment plan under the faulty pretense that I am not eligible for PSLF. As it turns out, I am in fact eligible and the 47 payments I have made so far meet or exceed what I would have paid under a PSLF eligible plan ; 5. I ask that all 47 payments ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) be accepted as qualifying payments as : ( i ) I have paid as much money as I would have under a PSLF eligible plan ; ( ii ) my loan servicer improperly maneuvered me into entering a PSLF-ineligible pay ment plan using misrepresentations ( whether intentional or not ) ; and ( iii ) all of these payments were made while I was employed full time by a PSLF-eligible employer. 

I am an XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) Veteran who served in the XXXX and was XXXX to XXXX as a medic in XXXX. I served my country for many reasons, one of which was the promise of financial help with college. This was a very attractive incentive for me as I come from a family with modest means. I was the first person in my family to be awarded a professional degree and navigated the process of applying and then paying for higher education on my own. The cost of professional school easily consumed all veteran benefits available to me ( GI Bill, State and Federal Tuition assistance programs ), thus federal loans became the only path through which I could afford higher education. During my professional studies, I unexpectedly I found myself caring for my father after a XXXX attempt as well as my oldest brother after he XXXX XXXX at a XXXX XXXX and was then out on XXXX  ( my brother unfortunately subsequently XXXX of an XXXX XXXX, highlighting another major catastrophe affecting our country ). I was happy to be able to support my father and brother during some difficult life circumstances but as I was myself a student at the time, this caused me to rely more heavily on federal loans, increasing my debt burden substantially. 
After graduation, I found myself with significant student loan debt but rather than entering a high paying job in the private sector, I chose to pursue further training in mental health pharmacy so I could go down a career path of helping veterans who have suffered worse than I. During this extra training my loan interest compounded. All of my personal and professional experiences detailed above have shaped my career path and goals and I now work with veterans who have experienced XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) and on XXXX XXXX XXXX in an effort to combat the unfortunate XXXX XXXX that is affecting so many families across the country. 
I write today to draw attention to a student loan issue that affects me and so many other student loan borrowers : the mishandling and misrepresentation of the PSLF program. The PSLF guidelines state that if you are employed full time by a qualified public service employer, then you need to make 120 payments in a specific repayment program to have your loans forgiven. In theory, it is a great opportunity for those who chose to work in a public sector job ( which in many cases means foregoing the higher payments of the private sector ). 
The flagrantly mishandled execution of the program, has left me with a sputtering launch into my adult professional career and family life. Navient incorrectly told me that my loans were not eligible for PSLF due to a payment that I had missed in XXXX. Navient relayed this to me in XXXX. My loans were deferred from XXXX while I was conducting training, though during this time the loans still accrued interest. My original loan amount was {$760000.00}, but as of XX/XX/XXXX, I owe {$91000.00}. I have made 47 payments totaling {$34000.00} since XX/XX/XXXX with a negligible impact to the principal loan balance. 
All of my 47 payments have been made while employed by an eligible PSLF employer. The attached employment verification forms cover all years where payments were made. My employers include the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ), the XXXX XXXX XXXX, and the XXXX XXXX XXXX. All of these employers are eligible for my payments to qualify under the PSLF program. As you can see in the attached information, the amounts paid in the ineligible payments are roughly the same as the amounts paid in the eligible payments. All payments consistently range between $ 600-800. 
The Implementation of the PSLF program needs to be reformed to make it more student friendly, aas Congress intended it to be. One way to accomplish this is to credit all payments as qualified PSLF payments that borrowers make while employed by an eligible employer. In this manner, the deceptive steering of borrowers into non-qualified payment plans can at least be attenuated, if not eliminated completely.",Student loan,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",4

4 ) I received another email saying they considered the matter closed as the receipt stated all services are final and there are no refunds. How can that be legal when XXXX did NOT deliver as she promised, as per our agreement when she demanded I pay her in full. 
5 ) The claim had to get re-opened as a Supervisor looked into it after another supervisor refused to listen to me and told me it was not their problem and I needed to take it up with XXXX  as I paid the charge and that meant I agreed to her terms and I had not proven my case. 
6 ) Comenity still agreed with the merchant and reversed the temporary credit saying her services are final and the charge is valid per the terms. What terms?

I am XXXX on XXXX XXXX  XXXX. I also received a personal injury settlement from my former employer on XX/XX/XXXX. Settlement was due to inability to work because of XXXX  and XXXX  XXXX. 
I have a family of XXXX. XXXX boys, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. I am married. 
I own one real estate property and it is my primary residence in the state of California. 
This is my 2nd complaint. 
One day before my exemption hearing, Bank of America 's legal representation, XXXX XXXX XXXX filed a 2nd attempt to levy my property. Case number XXXX P. 

I submitted a complaint approximately 3 weeks ago to your agency. 
I am sending a 2nd because the actions of both bank of America and XXXX XXXX XXXX should be considered as harassment and predatory in nature. 

Plaintiff is well aware of my financial situation. I submitted a financial statement showing I am upside dwon {$7500.00} to {$8000.00} each month. I am using personal injury settlement XXXX exempt ) to cover deficit. The settlement amount was supposed to cover my family for 24 months ( beginning XX/XX/XXXX ) with the hope I could return to work within that time period. 

I had major XXXX  XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, my wife was in a serious car accident on XX/XX/XXXX ( she was injured ). Her work vehicle was totaled. Then Bank of America levied {$32000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I am down to less than {$5000.00} of total available liquid funds. 

Not able to return to work in near future. may require XXXX XXXX and possible XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. 
Before BofA retained council, I spoke with BofA agents on a half dozen occasions. I explained if I could settle for a negotiated. amount I would do so. BofA kept harassing me, I continued to take their calls and re-told the same story. 

I have been with BofA credit card services for approximately 30 years. Paid monthly credit card bill in full with little exception. Less than 10 times I forgot to pay bill on time, accumulated minimal interest, paid bill. By and large I paid monthly charges in full. 
My credit limit was {$20000.00}. 
When I lost job accumulated higher amount of monthly charges, BofA without my written or verbal permission raised my credit limit to approximately {$50000.00}. 

This is a predatory tactic. I was in the middle of dealing with losing my mother, my job, dealing with health problems, not paying off monthly bills. And they raise limit at a time most banks would not. 
First, limit should not be raised without permission from card holder. Second, the timing is suspicious and predatory. Why not raise it during the two plus decades when I was paying off monthly balance? I think we all know the answer to describe their timing. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX have all the documentation showing XXXX payments and injury settlement. They know I'm down to my last {$5000.00}. They know I don't have the money to hire council. 
So, they make further attempts to increase the stress in my life, push me into further physical and emotional distress. Why? 

I don't have any money. I need the {$32000.00} levied on XX/XX/XXXX to be returned to my account. Otherwise I can't put a roof over my families head. Barely have money to purchase groceries, pay for medical bills.

"On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted my current mortgage servicer, Freedom Mortgage ( FM ) to see about an equity loan. In XXXX, FM contacted me repeatedly to do an equity loan. They told me in XXXX that my debt-to-income ratio was too high and I would need my husband on the loan. I vowed to change mortgage companies as soon as I could. However, FM contacted me earlier this year again about doing an equity loan. My husband and I had been actively looking for a way to consolidate our debt, so we canceled our XXXX XXXX application and went with FM. 

I have at least {$50000.00} of equity in my home. I have owned my home since XXXX, I have had no delinquent payment history on my credit report in 13 years. I was denied the loan based on "" not having consistent income in XXXX and XXXX ; '' despite the fact that I could show that I did, in fact, have consistent income. 

My husband and I applied jointly. Prior to pulling a hard credit inquiry and starting the application, I told XXXX XXXX with Freedom Mortgage that I have been a solo practicing attorney since XXXX and that I also work for my husband 's XXXX  ( XXXX ) since XXXX. I specifically stated that I make less through the XXXX. My husband also has been working for the same XXXX XXXX since XXXX. XXXX told me that he would only use my income from the XXXX, and if he needed me to provide information on my income as an XXXX, he would let me know. It all sounded promising, so my husband and I invested in making small improvements to guarantee that our house would appraise at the amount which we needed. 

My XXXX score was XXXX, my husband 's was XXXX. We provided our tax returns from XXXX and XXXX. We also provided pay stubs for XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX told me that I could not be on the loan for the home because I could not show consistent income in XXXX and XXXX as I do not have w-2s for the XXXX XXXX since I am a sole XXXX. I asked why I could not provide balance sheets and business account statements. I was even willing to provide redacted copies of retainer agreements. 

XXXX told me none of what I offered would be sufficient, that it HAD to be W2s. I later followed up and provided w-2s from the other jobs I have held in XXXX. I also was looking for W2s from XXXX. As I stated to XXXX, since I am a solo XXXX ( which means feast or famine ), I maintain various contracts as appointed counsel along with e-discovery positions. I also offered to provide the full tax returns with corresponding schedules so that he could see our income along with the deductions we were able to claim. XXXX told me that the information that I was offering still was not enough, that only w2s will show consistent income. He stated that my husband would have to be on the loan alone ... then stated to me that my husband would have had to been on the deed for 12 months prior to the application. XXXX knew full well that I purchased my home before I met my husband and that he would not be on the deed. 

My claims : Income discrimination : XXXXFreedom Mortgage would only accept W2s knowing that I am mainly a solo practicing attorney, and, as such, I would not have W2s for my solo practice. We told Freedom Mortgage that I was a solo XXXX from the beginning. Upon providing my pay stubs from the XXXX, my husband let XXXX know that I am XXXX versus a full-time permanent employee and that, because the XXXX just started being in the black as of this year that is why my payment history isn't beyond XXXX. After providing tax returns and pay stubs, I offered to provide further information to prove my income for XXXX and XXXX and XXXX/Freedom Mortgage would not work with me. I understand that with FHA loans there is no minimum income amount and the history only need be for the previous 12 months. Last year, it was "" your income is not sufficient, you need your husband on the loan. '' This year it's "" you can not prove consistent income. '' So, last year, my income was consistent. But this year it is not?

Racial discrimination : I believe race has a part to play in this because it is well-known that minorities are given more difficulty in trying to obtain loans. Here, Freedom Mortgage has no good reason to deny me from being on the loan of the home which I have maintained with no delinquent payments for the past 6 years. I am simply trying to do the same thing that many other homeowners do - utilize the equity in my home to get a handle on debt. I am left no choice but to believe these issues that FM is ONCE AGAIN taking me through is based on race. 

I have also just found that my monthly payment has arbitrarily increased by {$20.00}. It is ironic that it happened right after I notified FM of my intent to file consumer complaints and I have not received any prior notification of any issues with escrow or tax increase.",Mortgage,Freedom Mortgage Company,2

"I have a credit account with Paypal which uses Synchrony bank, they offer promotions such as six months with zero interest or zero interest with twelve easy payments. The problem is when I added auto pay I divided my balance by the number of promotional months and it would insure I would pay it off on time. When there is more than one promotion their computer allocates the payment not the consumer/me.

When I attempted to make extra payments I could not specify the allocation of where  the payment would be applied. I called and complained and they told me I would have to call them next time and make a payment to control where the payment would be allocated. I tried that and the payment still was not applied where I wanted it. I also had made a purchase for 12 easy payments, every month the auto payment was taking two payments and not one and putting less on the balance that needed it most. I have been struggling with synchrony bank for three months now, each month I get frustrated and have to call several time in an attempt to correct the payment allocation only for the payment to get messed up again the very next month. The last time I got so frustrated that I called and attempted to pay off the balance, I stated that I only wanted to pay off the six month balance at least six times and it did not pay off the balance because it applied 1 extra payment to the 12 month payment loan, the 12 easy payments keeps taking additional payments from every payment, this seems illegal. Where are my rights as a consumer?

This seems unethical that the bank or its computer makes my decision for me and takes away my autonomy. It also feels like synchrony bank intentionally sets people/me up to fail so Synchrony can go back to the original purchase date and charge customers/me outrageous interest rates. I know if synchrony bank is doing this to me they are also doing it to many under served people. The only solutions I can think of is to never have more than one purchase/promotion at a time or cancel the credit line altogether. 

Synchrony bank claims they are working on changing the computers algorithms and interface to offer the consumer control of their payment allocation rather than the computer deciding for you which currently works in the the banks best interest not the consumers. The customer service agent I spoke with stated that these kinds of things take a very long time to correct, hopefully enough people complain and give pushback to help them change it faster.",Credit card or prepaid card,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,1

XX/XX/XXXX, the divorce was finalized, and the divorce decree states that my now ex-wife was to retain possession of the XXXX, and was to refinance or payoff the loan to remove my name from the account.

"I am a first-time home buyer. In XX/XX/2019, I applied for a home mortgage loan with SunTrust Bank and worked with XXXX  XXXX  ( a mortgage loan consultant at SunTrust, NMLSR # XXXX  ). This was for a conventional 30-year mortgage with the initial sale price of {$760000.00} and an initial loan amount of {$680000.00} ( 10 % down payment ). OnXX/XX/2019, this loan consultant was provided with the name and contact information for the title company which would eventually be used for closing in XX/XX/2019 ( see PDF document "" XX/XX/2019 emails '' for proof ). At no point in time have we changed title companies.

From XXXX to XXXX, we select finishings/make modifications and the house gets built. The final sale price of the house is {$750000.00} ( see PDF "" Homeowner Transaction Summary '' which was put together by the builder ). This transaction summary is forwarded by the builder to the mortgage loan consultant at SunTrust Bank in XX/XX/2019.

In late XXXX/early XX/XX/2019, the builder sets a closing date of XX/XX/2019 at XXXX  XXXX  ( see PDF document "" Closing date set emails '' for proof ). The mortgage loan consultant is notified of the closing date and a mortgage loan commitment is re-issued ( see PDF document "" Mortgage loan commitment '' ). Please note that the loan amount listed on the re-issued mortgage loan commitment letter was {$680000.00} ( this is not 90 % of the final sale price of {$750000.00} listed on the Homeowner Transaction Summary ... instead, the bank/loan consultant worked off of old information from XX/XX/2019 ).

On XX/XX/2019 I text messaged the bank 's loan consultant and asked her to give me an idea of what interest rates would be if I were to put down 15 % of the total sales price ( instead of the initial 10 % noted above ). I ultimately decided on putting down 15 % and lock in an interest rate ( see PDF "" Rate lock email '' ). After locking the rate, the loan consultant sent me an initial closing disclosure on XX/XX/XXXX ( see PDF "" Initial closing disclosure '' ). I carefully reviewed the initial disclosure and emailed the loan consultant several questions ( see PDF "" Rate lock email '' ). Please note that the closing costs disclosed to me at this point totaled {$14000.00} and the loan amount was now correct at {$640000.00} ( 85 % of the final sale price {$750000.00} ).

On XX/XX/XXXX, I emailed the title company and requested the final amount that needed to be wired in order to close on the following day XX/XX/XXXX. The title company agent replied that they were waiting on the loan consultant at SunTrust Bank to provide them with the final numbers for closing ( see PDF "" XX/XX/XXXX emails '' ). The loan consultant then waits for the bank 's Closer to "" balance the figures '' with the title agent and a final amount to be wired on the day of closing (XX/XX/XXXX ) is settled upon by the two parties. This final amount was {$100000.00} ( of which total closing cost was now {$21000.00} ). The total closing cost was now {$6600.00} higher than what was listed on the initial disclosure sent to me on XX/XX/XXXX and so I was upset and shocked. I then asked the title agent for the breakdown / reconciled final disclosure so that I could review ( see PDF "" Final Disclosure '' ). I carefully review this and found that bulk of the discrepancy was related to transfer taxes. Transfer taxes were initially disclosed to me on XX/XX/XXXX as being paid by the seller. On XX/XX/XXXX, the final disclosure now stated that I had to pay these taxes. Upon reading the CFPB website, proper disclosure of transfer taxes ( who pays and what amount ) is one thing that can not change between the initial and final disclosure ( https : //www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/can-my-final-mortgage-costs-increase-from-what-was-on-my-loan-estimate-en-172/ ) and so I raised this question with the loan consultant. The loan consultant finally replied to my calls/email and admitted that the bank based the initial closing disclosure costs and transfer taxes ( including who pays what ) on a completely different title company called XXXX  XXXX. This company is one we were never working with or had even heard of ( see PDF "" Incorrect title company '' ). It appears that the bank 's Closer did not work with the correct title company or know/understand who pays what until the day before closing.

I am filing this complaint because I feel that the bank had over 6 months to work with the pre-specified title company ( selected in XX/XX/2019 as noted above ) and create an accurate initial closing disclosure so that I would not have to deal with the shock of an unexpected {$6600.00} increase in closing costs on the day prior to closing. I am especially frustrated because the bulk of the unexpected increased in closing costs were related to transfer taxes. The bank made a mistake in my opinion, and I feel that if the bank would have just worked with the pre-specified title company to begin with, I would have had a more accurate estimate and understanding of my closing costs. I still have no resolution to this issue.",Mortgage,"SUNTRUST BANKS, INC.",2

"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a phone call from People 's Bank call center number stating that there were  potential fraudulent charges on my account. The caller said there was a charge to XXXX, and one to XXXX   out of Georgia, which I confirmed were fraudulent and said do not process. The caller then listed off my last 2 days worth of debit transactions - date, place, and amounts. He said they were freezing my account due to the fraudulent attempts at XXXX and XXXX. He stated they could allow me to have {$200.00} of my balance available so that I could go to the branch and make a withdrawal to cover my gas and grocery expenses, but that I would have to close my existing accounts and open new ones. 

After I got off the phone with him, I received emails from Peoples Bank stating 2 different individuals were added as person to person contacts, and that payments were initiated to each of them in the amount of {$500.00} per transfer ( total of {$1000.00} stolen ). I immediately called the People 's Bank fraud department ( it took 25 minutes on hold to get through to a rep ), while I was on hold I responded to People 's Bank emails stating my account had been hacked, these are fraudulent charges, and I do not authorize them. I also said the same to the rep from the Fraud Department when I got through. They advised me they were freezing the accounts, to go to my local branch the next day ( it was already after banking hours ) to file an affidavit of dispute, close my existing accounts, and open new ones. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I went to People 's Bank with the completed affidavit, screen shots of the phone call that came to me from their call center number, and copies of the emails that I received and replied to disputing the charges. While they were opening up new accounts for me, they advised me that the phone number on my account had been changed - my phone number was deleted, and a new phone number of XXXX was added to my account. They couldn't explain to me how this happened, or why I didn't receive a security alert text message from them notifying me of the change when it occurred. They faxed the paperwork to the claims department and said I would hear back in a few days. 

I didn't hear back from them, so I called the Claims Department on XX/XX/XXXX and they told me that the claim was denied. They said I must've given the person information to get into my account - I again explained he was already in my account and had all my recent transactions when he called me. The fraud department said they can't explain how that happened, there was nothing more they can do, and to have the local branch manager contact them. I called XXXX XXXX, Branch Manager, explained the situation again and she contacted them. After speaking with them, XXXX said to me that the Claims Department is "" inundated with fraudulent claims and they are just denying all of them ''. She provided them with additional information, they agreed to reopen my case and have it back in "" processing status ''. She told me to call back in a few days to follow up. I called her on XX/XX/XXXX to follow up, she reached out to the Claims Department again, and they said the case was still pending, she said she would call me back when they have an answer. I didn't hear back from anyone as of Monday XXXX, so I called XXXX back. She reached out to the Claims Department and again they said they had closed the case, rejected the claim, and there was nothing more they would do to fix the situation. I asked for a call back from a Regional Manager as this was unsatisfactory, no fault of mine, this person was already in my account when he called me, somehow there were no safeguards in place at the bank which allowed him to change the demographics in my account, I notified them immediately when this happened, filed all the necessary paperwork and supporting documentation, and this was clearly a security breach on their end. I got a call from XXXX XXXX who said he's the Customer Experience Manager for XXXX County. He said he can't explain how the person was in my account before they called me, has no explanation as to how he was able to delete my contact information and input his own, and also doesn't know why there aren't safeguards in place that all other banks have such as 24 hour holding periods when new Person to Person Contacts are added, to prevent people being able to immediately wipe out funds. When I asked about my deposits being federally insured, and how I'm supposed to feel safe depositing my funds into their bank accounts, he said FDIC only applies "" if the bank gets robbed '', if they don't have proper cyber security and safety measures in place, and someone hacks the bank account and wipes out a person 's savings, there is nothing the bank will do about it. 

I went back to the local branch last night, XX/XX/XXXX, and spoke with XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, branch managers, to request a full transaction history - both from a fiduciary standpoint and also demographic standpoint, asking for all memos to file with regards to when changes were made to my account, how they were done ( online or via phone ), etc. because this was clearly a breach in security and a full Account Takeover. They couldn't provide me with a printout of the memos to file with time stamps as to when it occurred, nor would the Claims Department. The Claims Department asked for a request from an Attorney before they would release that. They provided me with a printout of the account statement ( nothing more than what I could've downloaded online ), and a handwritten note stating that on XX/XX/XXXX through online banking, my phone number was deleted, and a number of ( XXXX ) XXXX was added to the account. Again, they couldn't explain why I did not get a text message notification from People 's Bank when this change occurred, or why someone was able to add these fraudulent Person to Person contacts and within minutes start immediately withdrawing funds. 

I acted on this situation within minutes of seeing the emails - less than an hour after the Person to Person transactions happened. I provided all requested documentation immediately, and filed the affidavit immediately. I have been banking with People 's for over 15 years, I have never had a Person to Person account setup, I have never in 15 years wired funds to anyone, I have never had a fraudulent claim, or requested stop payments on any checks. I can not believe that within minutes someone can hack into my account, wipe out {$1000.00} and the bank refuses to do anything to remedy this situation when this clearly was a security breach with improper safeguards on their end. As a single mother, I live paycheck to paycheck. That {$1000.00} was everything that was set aside at the end of the month for all of my utilities. As a result of this, I ended up with past due payments to my utility accounts, and was left scrambling for money to cover gas to get back and forth to work, as well as groceries to feed my XXXX. I am also very distressed by the fact that I was told the fraud department is "" inundated with claims '', and days after this happened to me, an alert was put up on the home page of the People 's Bank website. It is quite obvious that I am not the only person this has happened to recently. I can't understand how the bank is allowed to get away with this - they are accepting deposits from customers who think that their money is safe in an account, they don't have proper security in place so they are completely liable for this, and now they won't rectify their errors.",Checking or savings account,"PEOPLE'S UNITED BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",3

We called Capital One asking for reimbursement for the past 3 years of repeatedly trying to cancel this product and asked them about a consent order issued by the CFPB ( file number XXXX ) that they were supposed to reimburse anyone who tried to cancel the product after XX/XX/XXXX and was unsuccessful. They responded that we came from Household Bank at that time. They took over Household Bank XX/XX/XXXX on our end, the CFPB issued the order in XXXX of XXXX. Whether or not that applies, the Administrative proceeding, terminating the consent order on XX/XX/XXXX from the CFPB, states that Capital One canceled their add on products since XXXX, this is obviously not true and I believe because of the different name of the same product of concern. We were being charged for a product that was an add on that we asked repeatedly for 3 years to cancel through Capital One, throughout the entire Consent order they needed to comply with. Was the consent order specifying a particular add on product for debt protection? Are they allowed to just ignore us repeatedly when asked to be reimbursed after they said they would the first time we canceled?",Credit card or prepaid card,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,1

"On XXXX and XXXX XX/XX/2019 I received an email from Capital One saying that my new credit cards had shipped. I have two cards with the company so this made sense. I figured that the old cards had expired or there had been a security breach so they were issuing new cards. On XX/XX/2019 I received one of the cards that had been sent to me. It was XXXX XXXX and left unsecured on my front steps. I looked at the card and compared it to the one that it was supposed to replace. They had the same expiration date and card number which seemed odd. I had fraud on my Capital One accounts a few years ago so I called the number on the card to check the balance to make sure everything was ok. I rarely use either of my Capital One cards and had not used either one in several months so the balance should have been XXXX. The balance on that card was XXXX. I decided that since I was on the phone Id check the balance of my other card, which I had not yet received. It too should have been XXXX. It was several hundred dollars. I listened to a list of the most recent charges. All of them were from a day or two before at merchants near my house but places that I had never been to. I spoke with representative and they sent me to a fraud specialist. I explained what had happened. They informed me that they I was not responsible for the charges and that they would cancel both cards and send new cards and begin an investigation. 
After thinking about it for a few hours I realized what had happened. Someone had used my personal information, which I know had been leaked because of the fraud on my Capital One account years before, to order new cards. Since they had my personal information they also knew my address. They waited for the XXXX XXXX truck to drop off the first card and took it while I was at work and then immediately went out and started using it. The second card, which alerted me to the problem, arrived on a Saturday so I got to it first. 
I called back Capital One and explained to them what I thought had happened. They assured me that they would include the information in my file and give it to the investigators. I also asked them how we could prevent this from happening in the future since whomever stole my identity could pull the same trick again. They told me that they would make a note in my file that only calls from my cell phone would considered valid in the future. I hung up feeling like they were handling the situation and taking care of me. 
A few days later I received the card to replace the one that had been stole off of my front steps. But I never received the one to replace the other card which had also been cancel. Around XXXX XX/XX/2019 I called again and told the agent that I believed that someone was stealing the cards off of my front step and to cancel that card that I had never received and send a new one but this time not to XXXX XXXX   but just to mail it so that it would be placed safely into my mail slot. 
Around XXXX XX/XX/2019 I received my Capital One card bill for the card that had been stolen off of my steps second. I had a XXXX dollar charge on it that I had never made and Capital One had charged me XXXX dollars to XXXX  XXXX the card that had been stolen. I immediately called them up and explained the whole situation again. They told me that the XXXX dollar charge had been made on the card that I had never received and that card was cancelled and I was not liable for it. They also reversed the XXXX dollar expedition fee. Again I felt like they were taking care of the situation. 
On XXXX XX/XX/2019 I received a very cheerful voice message from XXXX who was an investigator with Capital One informing me that he had completed his investigation and to call him if he had any questions. I had already been assured that I was not liable for any of the fraudulent charges so I did not feel a need to call. 
On XXXX XX/XX/2019 I opened the Capital One app to check my credit card balance which I have been doing every few days since the fraudulent activity. It was much higher than I expected. I locked my card and called Capital One again. I called them from my work phone and expected them to require me to call them from my cell phone since they had told me that in the future that was how they would verify that it was me and not the person that stole my identity. They asked me some basic information that the identity thief knows and then verified that it was me. Clearly they had made no progress in securing my accounts from further fraud. The representative told me that the charges were not new but were old charges that had been put back on. I was then transferred to another representative. I told her the exact same information that I had told Capital One several times before. She then transferred me to XXXX who does investigations for Capital One. I was informed that since the card had a chip and that since the chip was used in the store that XXXX the first investigator had determined that I was lying and that the charges were not fraud and that I was liable for them. Again for the sixth or seventh time I explained the entire history of events. XXXX gave me her number and said that she would reopen the case with the new information. When I told her that I had been assured that to avoid future identity theft and fraud they would require me to call on my cell phone she told me that really would not work. When I asked how they would prevent the same thing from happening in the future she did not have an answer. 
In summary. Over two months after I reported the identity theft and fraud I am being told that they might try to hold be liable for the fraudulent charges and they still have not secured my accounts from future fraud.",Credit card or prepaid card,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,1

"My car was crashed, and Capital One Auto Finance seems to be involved in unfair practices. The following is notes that I have kept : Timeline of Incidences After Crash XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX  Car crash ( No injuries, No other vehicle-car vs. tree ) XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX Florida Highway Patrol made traffic crash report, XXXX XXXX   received a text from an officer advising vehicle towed by XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX to their tow yard in XXXX Florida. Also, the trooper advised the report would be emailed to me. 
XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX ( I am unsure which date they called because I was confused about how they were involved at this point ) I received a call from Capital One Auto Finance requesting my intention with the car. I advised I was claiming it on my insurance. Capital One did not ask for my insurance information. I was thanked for my great payment record, and the representative ended the call. 
XX/XX/XXXX I was waiting for the crash report to provide to insurance but decided since Capital One was inquiring, I needed to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX   XXXX XXXX. A report was made by XXXX XXXX XXXX and forwarded to XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX. I received an email from XXXX, providing my claim number and claim representatives name ( XXXX XXXX ). 
XX/XX/XXXX I emailed Ms. XXXX regarding the fact that I had the only key that the appraiser will probably need it to appraise the car. I also needed a rental car before the weekend. She called me and said to drop the key at the tow yard and provided me with rental information.I called XXXX XXXX XXXX to drop off key after XXXX, and I asked if there was a dropbox. They advised I would need to meet a driver at the lot and to give them a 90-minute head start to have a driver available. I left work an hour and a half early to get to the lot before XXXX, so I wouldn't have to meet someone. I got there around XXXX XXXX, and no one was in the office even though there was an open sign on the door. I called XXXX 's XXXX again, and the woman was irritated that I didn't let them know in advance that I would be in before XXXX XXXX. I said I was sorry ; I thought she said I had to give them notice if I was coming after XXXX XXXX. I waited on the driver and provided him with the key. I wanted to retrieve my belongings, but I didn't have my registration, so I said I would be back the following day. 
XX/XX/XXXX I went to the tow yard and advised the registration must be in the car. I was able to take my property, including my car tag. I signed a release statement to release the car to the insurance company, then went to XXXX to pick up my rental. In the meantime, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX sent an appraiser to check the vehicle at the tow yard. ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX I received a voicemail from the appraiser ( XXXX XXXX ). I called him back and was advised that he couldn't see the damage under the hood. He asked which body shop to send the car. They will know more after getting the car on a lift. I advised I wanted it sent to XXXX XXXX in XXXX, FL. 
XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from Ms. XXXX advising the car was repairable. She asked which body shop we wanted to use. I advised ( again ) XXXX XXXX in XXXX. I said I told the appraiser the same yesterday. I said since it was not at the body shop yet, I was curious if the appraisal was completed. She assured me it was, and said she would send a check in my name along with my husband, and XXXX XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX I received the check in the mail. Also, I received a notice from the post office that I had certified mail from XXXX XXXX XXXX. I wasn't overly concerned about the certified mail from XXXX XXXX XXXX because I thought the car was sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX Monday morning to find out when I should bring the check. XXXX did not have my car. I then called XXXX XXXX XXXX, and they advised that my car was picked up by the lienholder ( Capital One Auto Finance ). I then called Capital One and spoke with someone named XXXX ( no last name provided ) and was advised they picked up my car to secure it because the tow yard could auction it off if it stayed there too long. I let them know that it was in the middle of an insurance claim. He asked for my claim #, insurance agency name, and claim representatives information. He said someone at Capital One would call the insurance representative and determine how to get the car to the right place. He also sent a fraud claim resolution letter to my email address naming me as a victim and stating the trade line would be deleted from my credit reports. Email sent to Ms. XXXX to advise the situation. She didn't understand why the lienholder was involved. She thought I called them. I told her I did not. I told her they would contact her. Also, I mentioned again that I thought the appraisal was not complete. She advised that it was ; that the body shop could request supplemental checks if necessary. 
XX/XX/XXXX I emailed Ms. XXXX asking if Capital One contacted her yet. 
XX/XX/XXXX Email received from Ms. XXXX, no contact from Capital One. I called Capital One again. I spoke with XXXX ( no last name provided ) I was told they could not speak with Ms. XXXX because she wasn't on my account. He asked how I intended to pay the impound and repossession fees. I said that I wasn't, insurance should cover me. I provided permission for Ms. XXXX to call and straighten everything out. Ms. XXXX called Capital One and was advised the fees must be paid by debit card. They wouldn't accept a check from insurance. She called me back. She said I could pay upfront, and insurance would pay me back. I said I don't have money. This is not my fault. She said to get Capital One to provide a bill, and they would send me a check, then I could cash it and pay for the fees. I called Capital One back and didn't get the person 's name ( all calls were recorded ) and asked for the bill, so insurance could pay and was told they do not have the ability to print the bill/invoice. Maybe I could stop at a Capital One store. I asked where I might find a Capital One store, and the man said he didnt know. I looked for one, and the closest is over 200 miles away. Email back to Ms. XXXX to ask for the fee information because I was at the hospital all day as my grandchild was being born, so I didn't have paper and pen or time to write the amounts down. She emailed me back with the info and then said they could only cover the impound fee ( {$350.00} ), not the repossession fee ( {$290.00} ). I called the impound yard ( XXXX XXXX ) to get a bill to provide to the insurance company. I was given the number to the actual lot ( XXXX XXXX ). I had to leave my phone number for a callback. Another call to Capital One advising they should waive the repo fee because it was not my fault. The car is paid in advance every month. I was told by XXXX ( she provided her id "" XXXX '' ) that they could email me a reinstatement notice that will only show the total of both the repo and impound fees. She said she could help by putting {$190.00} of the repo fee to the end of my loan, but everything has to be paid upfront. 
Checked mailbox for physical mail ( none received ) and put signed USPS to leave the certified letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX so I could see precisely what Capital One received. 
XX/XX/XXXX Checked mail for any notices. ( none received ) XX/XX/XXXX No email received from Capital One. No callback from the impound lot. I called Capital One. XXXX ( Id # XXXX ) answered. I advised I needed a supervisor. He forwarded me to their Customer Advocacy Team. I spoke to XXXX ( ID # XXXX ). I complained that I did not receive a bill. She said there was an issue with emailing it to me. I explained that no one contacted me before picking up the vehicle. She said she would check to see if anyone called. I said if they called, they would have needed to leave a voicemail, which they did not. XXXX said it would have only been as a courtesy anyway. She said I was in breach of my contract. I said, It makes no sense that I have paid all payments on time, and the car was taken while insurance was handling the claim. How am I in breach of my contract? She didnt have an answer. I was not notified in any way so that I could attempt to contact the insurance rep to get the car removed into their custody. She said I would be receiving a notice of intent in the mail. I said, Ok, so Im receiving it in the mail, which will take more time. I thought the issue was saving tow yard fees. It is sitting in an impound lot now. She put me on hold. When she returned, she stated that the letter was being emailed to me, which included the {$290.00} repo fee. ( I suppose the deal to add {$190.00} to the end of my loan is off the table. ) We ended the call. I emailed XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX. The following is the email in its entirety : Good morning. I finally got Capital One to provide a document. I can not pay the fee for the repossession, and they refuse to waive it. They said Capital One attempted to contact your office before impounding it. The point is that I didn't receive notice from XXXX XXXX XXXX, Capital, nor your office advising me that the car was being repossessed. I know that you were not aware because I was able to speak with you after it was impounded elsewhere. XXXX ( id # XXXX ) at Capital one said that insurance dragged their feet, so they had to secure their interest. I asked why no one called me. She said that she would check to see if they did. I said if they did, they needed to leave a voicemail, and they did not. She said they were not required to. It would have been a courtesy call. I am filing a complaint with the State Attorney at this point. This is so unfair. XXXX XXXX Call received from Ms. XXXX. I explained my conversations with Capital One. She was going to speak with her supervisor. I filed a complaint on XXXX XXXX with the Florida State Attorney General. Call received from insurance, and they will write a check for the total. I must pick up the check and put it in my checking account. Then call Capital One with the debit card and pay the fees. The insurance is adding it to the amount of the claim. 
I checked my mail to see if I received any notices from yesterday around 3 pm. the box was empty. 
XX/XX/XXXX I checked my mail this morning. Yesterday 's mail was there. I received my certified notice from XXXX XXXX XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX. I saw that the Postal Carrier initialed and dated when he or she first brought the letter, when they received my signed notice back, and when the letter would be returned to XXXX XXXX   XXXX. I also received a notice from Capital One dated XX/XX/XXXX. Upon reading both notices, I discovered that XXXX XXXX XXXX sent their notice to all entities involved, so I guess they operate under a first-come, first-serve basis. I see they quote Florida Statutes stating they can sell the vehicle after 35 days. Capital One picked up the car sometime after the appraiser appraised the car on XX/XX/XXXX and before XX/XX/XXXX when I discovered the car was missing. The notice Capital One Provided came after the date of picking up the vehicle as it is dated XX/XX/XXXX. I called them on XX/XX/XXXX, thinking they would apologize ; instead, they are holding the car hostage requiring fees. I say they are using unfair practices, and because they are a big company, they think they can push me ( their own customer ) around. I expect it from the towing company, but not from my finance company when I followed the rules. 

I apologize for this long complaint, but I have had a lot going on between these companies. At this time, my insurance company has provided a check for the fees, and we ( myself and the insurance company ) are unsure if the car is even repairable. In the end, I will still probably be held responsible for everything. I will attach everything I can for your review. I thank you in advance for your assistance.",Vehicle loan or lease,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,5

"I brought up this exact concern to the Home depot before opening my account. I was guaranteed by the credit account manager that the Home Depot would never change account terms to add full back interest after the two year promotion date was over. Specifically he said that "" The Home Depot cares too much for its customers to do that '' and that my account was "" Two years no interest '' and that my concern was "" two years deferred interest ''. THAT IS HOW HE SOLD ME ON CREATING AN ACCOUNT. Additionally, since I spend so much time TDY away from home, I have always set up payments so that purchases will be payed off in full before the end of two years. this method of managing my account has worked well for ten years with no problems until now. I don't know what went wrong. The auto payment were not nearly as agreed, in fact Citi made them digressive until the end of the two years and then added the full back interest to the principle. This is terrible PREDATORY lending and an internet search reveals Citi as absolutely famous for this. I contacted them when I learned about this and asked them to contact me to discuss it. No one contacted me. They just left me a message that they turned down my request. ( Which I hadn't even had a chance to explain yet ) Now, over a year later I have had some time to re-visit the issue and when I contacted Citi executives I was told that it had been too long ( even though I first contacted them when it happened ) and that it was my fault since I "" chose not to manage my account ''. 
I don't deserve this. NO ONE DOES. 

1 I have excellent credit and have never missed a payment so why are Predatory Banks like City allowed to charge any interest rate they please?? 
2 why can Banks change the terms of credit accounts as the please and then tell me that "" they sent me letter '' informing me of the change in terms?? Should notification methods be adiquate for EVERYONE, even if some people spend much time away from their place of residence. Why can't changes REQUIRE a confirmation.

3 How can organizations like Home Depot, Best Buy, Costo and others allow their customers to be taken advantage of by such a predatory lender as Citi?

"Hello, On XX/XX/XXXX was conditionally approved for a chase mortgage refinance. On XX/XX/XXXX after three months of financial inquiries I received a verbal after weeks of asking for an update my refinance is being declined and I will not be refunded {$500.00}. The reason for the decline is because I do not have a sale agreement to support the payoff of an auto loan in my account and the check is written directly to me. What is even worst Chase was not aware of the payoff as it was not on my credit report and shared with them so they can include in financial responsibility re adjustment. I am being informed the {$500.00} is not being refunded due to fees incurred, but every week I was following up and would not hear back for days as the front line rep was constantly waiting on under writing. One fee they are staying is appraisal which was {$350.00} but they fail to inform you they charge you an extra {$50.00} because the company they use charge them this. Appraisal was conducted too early and should have been done once all financial reviewed were completed so the customer does not incur and unnecessary charge if they are declined for financial reasons. Additional, they submitted my items to title company who has called my employer three times wanting me to complete information with me which I am sure is a cost as well.

"Responding to a letter dated XX/XX/2019 from XXXX. XXXX US Bank customer Advocacy. In this letter of explanation and justification of allowing US Bank to request Two months mortgage payment before the grace period of 15 days is up ( early issue of mortgage statement ). Which is before a delinquent periodic payment has happened ( incurring late penalties )? Using mortgage banking terms or internal process as part of the 15day grace period, afforded to US Bank Servicing ( yet out of the customer hands ) in effect, do not appear to be per the loan documents and may most likely reduce the grace period at the pleasure of US Bank servicing. It will further allow US Bank justification of collecting late fees for internal process and or common used mortgage terms applications, not common to customers, blaming these processes of a customer mortgage payment being processed beyond the periodic payment period ( late fee after 15days ), justifying collection of a late fee. The loan documents periodic payment becomes past due, or when a late fee may be assessed, on the 16 day following the due date of the 1st. This is stated not only by their loan officer but on the Federal Truth and lending documents as well as on the loan documents themselves. Payments are deemed received by lender when received at the location designated in the note or at such other location as may be designated by lender in accordance with the notice provisions in Section 15. This letter in effect, directs further loan requirements not on the signed loan documents, but rather on the back of US Bank servicing department payment stub which limits or inhibits the 15 day grace period allowed with the loan documents.

When I called I spoke to XXXX XXXX to start the process. During the time of asking and answering questions I was asked if I had ever refinanced my home. I of course said yes I had done a modification in XXXX. I was then told that amount had to be paid back first and added the end of the original loan and would then be less that amount for the cash out I would receive. 
I understood and agreed. 
After several other errors made by Mr. XXXX whom was laid off due to this issue with this account, I finally asked for someone else to help me. 
I then started working with XXXX XXXX. Everything seemed to be going fine and when I came to closing out the paper work I was then put into contact with XXXX XXXX. 
When talking with her several other changes where made do to the miss information I had been given by Mr. XXXX. 
During closing I received my Payoff Statement and it clearly has a line saying "" Deferred Pursuant to Loan Modification : {$6000.00} My original Loan principal Balance was {$62000.00} with other charges and the modification being one of them the payoff balance was {$67000.00} I never questioned the amount asked being they are the mortgage company looking up the information to give me. 

My husband and I closed on the house XXXX of XXXX and received the equity cash out a week after closing. Everything at that point seemed to be fine.

On XXXX I again sent XXXX XXXX from Carrington Mortgage an email because I never heard back from her. She responded with an email stating they didn't see any error on their part but I again had her refer to one of the documents I had sent to her on XXXX of the Carrington Payoff Statment On XXXX she emailed me back stating I was right and had even highlighted the line on the Payoff Statement of the payment On XXXX I emailed XXXX XXXX of Carrington Mortgage and asked for the document of payment to be sent to me for my records. 
On XXXX I again emailed XXXX XXXX of Carrington Mortgage and asked again for the document of payment be sent to me. 
I never heard anything back again until XXXX when she called me to ask me to call her to discuss the account. 
I had missed her call at the time so I emailed her that I would call her once I was off of work. 
When I called her she proceeds to tell me that the loan for HUD was different from the Deferred Loan Modification. I disagreed with her and told her that couldn't be because that was the only time I had processed any modifications. When I asked her what and who was paid the {$6000.00} I was told that was for other fees and penalties. She couldn't explain anything more. She told me I could apply to re refinance and go through that entire process again. She had tried to tell me I had been misinformed by XXXX and that XXXX XXXX must of missed the HUD loan. 
When I said I would not be refinancing anything she then said I would need to contact XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX of any questions I had. 
I emailed XXXX XXXX again on XXXX requesting who was paid the {$6000.00} and that I wanted an itemized statement for that amount. She responded with - refer any questions to XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX.

"I am the personal representative for my mother 's estate, who passed away in a XXXX XXXX  about 3 weeks ago. My initial contact with Wells Fargo ( XXXX, AL ) took place on or about XX/XX/XXXX. I presented a General Durable Power of Attorney filed in the State of Alabama XXXX County for my mother naming me as her agent. I understand, typically, a POA is void after the principal 's death. However, the POA my mother had prepared by an attorney, explicitly  stated the following : "" this General Durable Power of Attorney, which shall not be affected by my disability, incapacity, incompetency, DEATH nor shall it be affected by any lapse of time ''. It is dated XX/XX/XXXX, which has the signature of my mother and two witnesses. The personal banker ( XXXX  ) at the Wells Fargo location XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX, AL contacted the legal department to approve the document. The first legal point of contact approved the POA. However, XXXX advised the POA required a second approval by a separate legal area. The representative spoke with XXXX XXXX ( spelling may be incorrect ) in the legal area, his direct manager is XXXX XXXX ( spelling may be incorrect ). These individuals refused to honor the POA, which was accepted by a couple of other banks including XXXX, without any issues. I asked for the section in the Consumer Deposit Account Agreement with the language related to the requirements for accepting a General Durable POA or closing an account due to death. However, XXXX nor XXXX were able to provide the justification within Wells Fargo Deposit Account agreement for refusing to honor the POA.

After Wells Fargo 's refusal to honor the General Durable POA, my mother had prepared by an attorney, which included her signature and two witnesses. I obtained a certified copy of my mother 's death certificate from the XXXX County Coroner 's Office. Since, my mother passed away in a fire, the coroner 's office needs more time to determine the actual cause of her death. Therefore, the cause of her death is still being determined and will take up to 8 weeks. Then, I proceeded to obtain Letters of Administration from XXXX County Probate Court, which I am listed as my mother 's personal representative. 

Thereafter, I presented the Certified Death Certificate signed and sealed by the coroner 's office and Letters of Administration to Wells Fargo. Again, Wells Fargo refused to accept these documents without just cause. The reason provided for refusing to accept the duly obtained documents was they required an original death certificate. This is completely ridiculous to require an original death certificate why does Wells Fargo need to know the reason for my mother 's death, which is the only item missing from the Certified Death Certificate. XXXX/Wells Fargo then advised, I had to open an estate account with Wells Fargo. Under the law, Wells Fargo does not have the right to require my mother 's estate account opening at Wells Fargo.

I have even opened an estate account at XXXX to execute the handling of my mother 's affairs, accordingly.

"FYI-I have the money to pay to get out of foreclosure so this is not about me trying to get something for free just because. I have had to quite a few things to get almost $ 10k and I shouldn't have to. This shouldn't be allowed. 

My mortgage was sold to SPS in XXXX of 2019. My house payment is automatically taken from my bank for the mortgage every month. In XXXX, I called my house insurance to get a monthly price of what I was paying and found out that my insurance had not been paid ( It's escrowed ) for so long that they dropped me and I didn't have house insurance. I called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  and they informed me that they didn't have my mortgage and SPS had it. So first off, no one paid the the insurance. Secondly, my payments were still being sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  sent my payments from XXXX to XXXX to SPS but discontinued after that. I spoke to SPS and asked them if they could help me get the money from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  and they said that they could not because it wasn't a situation where the payment was just "" lost ''. Upon further investigation the funds started coming back into my account at the bank around XXXX without any notification. I have alerts on my phone for anything taken out and deposit but it was a reversal so it didn't alert me. I offered to show proof to SPS that I never stopped making payments and they were made every month on time ahead of schedule ... just to XXXX XXXX XXXX. They wouldn't tell me what to do other than they needed all of the payments. In the meantime, I had to search around for more house insurance so we were covered. They wouldn't accept payments from me unless it was the full amount from XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and so forth. I have not received any calls from SPS but have kept in contact with them. In XXXX I went online to see if I had a case manager yet ( I didn't ) and started playing on the website where I found a document giving me the option to pay XXXX, XXXX and XXXX and then regular payments after that for a modified mortgage. I tried to pay at the end of XXXX and was told I couldn't because It started in XXXX. No one told me this modified offer. No one called me and no one emailed it to me. So now we are up to XXXX. They still won't accept my money because it is not paying it off. I finally spoke to someone who helped me. The amount due was {$6600.00} at that point although my monthly payments missed added up totaled around {$2400.00} give or take since my insurance wasn't paid. I explained that I work full time 50 hours a week with a commute of no less than 2 1/2 hours a day every day. I am a single mother of a  XXXX year old and XXXX XXXX XXXX year old who  is considered XXXX currently. She spent 6months in the hospital at which time, I still made sure that every bill was paid for by depleting my 401k since I couldn't work due to having XXXX   while XXXX. She was born at 25 weeks XXXX. The woman was understanding and put me on hold. She came back and said she spoke to someone and was told if I could pay {$4200.00} that would stop the XXXX Foreclosure sale of my home, my children 's home. The rest could be paid monthly in extra payments with my normal monthly payment. I specifically asked her by when and her response was, "" Well I mean I'd get it as soon as possible since it sale is XX/XX/XXXX. '' I thanked her and told her I'd get it. At the end of XXXX, I called in to get the wire information to send the money and was told they wouldn't accept it because it was not the full amount. I explained to her the conversation that I had prior and she just kept telling me that they would never have said that. XX/XX/XXXX. I called once again to get it paid and was told again that there is nothing that I can do unless it is in full. In fact, NOW they want {$8600.00} from me to save my home, my babies only home they know. I can't refinance anywhere because of medical bills and also now it shows on my credit report that I haven't paid my house payment in months. Me and my children are going to be living in my car because they DOUBLED the amount owed within weeks. Even with all the wrong doings between XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and SPS, I still wouldn't have sent complaints in but they are strong arming me out of my home and giving me unrealistic pay offs. All I want is for them to accept my {$4200.00} and let me pay the rest off by paying extra with my monthly payments as agreed upon 2 phone calls ago. Let me save my home. Give me a chance that they won't take off of me last second like they have. I have never been told so many times that someone wouldn't accept my payments. 

To whom it may concern, I spoke to the company again on Friday the XXXX to find out they jacked the price again. 

I havent received anything. I called today and they dont see where they mailed a letter or where they were supposed to. She offered to give me the quote and low and behold the amount was jacked up again to {$9000.00} XXXX.

I asked the associate if I could make payments over the minimum and when I do, would that automatically be applied to the balance I owe for taxes. She confidently replied YES.

I then called the bank and spoke to a Chase representative and I was then informed by the telephone banking representative that my account was blocked and I was unable to use it due to fraudulent activity. The representative proceeded to ask me where did I get the funds from, who gave the checks to me, and insinuated that I was committing fraud. I informed the representative that the checks were never reported stolen. That Thursday XX/XX/2019 I was to receive a payroll deposit from a XXXX XXXX   XXXX government agency and when I went to check my account balance I saw that my direct deposit did not post to my account.

I have been getting direct deposit to my account for over 3 years from the same government agency. I was told the funds would be available the following Tuesday because that Monday was a holiday and the bank was closed so I had to wait an extra day.

I then went to the a branch on XXXX XXXX  to withdraw the funds and I was told that I had to see a banker. When I went to the banker he told me that he had to get permission to release the funds because my account was flagged for fraud. A couple days went by and my account was now closed. At no time out of all the times I had contacted Chase had any of Chase bank representatives contacted me regarding the closing of my account. I called the bank again regarding the account closing and after being questioned about where I got the check from again, and who did it belong to and I had committed fraud, I was then told that the person whose check it belong to needed to come to the bank and verify/authorize my depositing the funds into my account. From day one I was never informed of the proper steps to take to resolve the issue. 
I then came into the bank at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, New York with the person to authorize the check deposit was not fraudulent and I had permission to make the check deposit and to reopen the account so the funds would be released.

I then went back to the bank on Monday XX/XX/2019 and spoke to the branch manager again and she forwarded me to one of the bankers at the XXXX XXXX branch named XXXX. XXXX advised me that the check was sent to some other department for release and that my accounts were closed and I would have to withdraw the funds that were remaining in that account. XXXX then called their 1800 customer service phone line where he spoke to one of his colleagues to locate the whereabouts of the check and verified that we took the proper steps to verify the check deposit. After verifying all of the information, I was told the check would be overnighted to me, that never happened. I then called the bank again and I was told that it would not be mailed out until the following week. During this time I was told since this account was closed I could reopen another account, a few days later this account was closed causing my direct deposit to return back to my employer. I was then told that I could not open another account at Chase. This has caused my bills to fall behind and my reputation to open an account at Chase Bank to end.

This does not make sense, I never created a contact number in my XXXX XXXX profile for this neighbor, which does not share our family name. So Radius Global Solutions lied to me knowingly breaking the law on sharing personal information on a US consumer.

A copy of their own letter stating the amount needed to cure the default was included with the check when we sent it to them. The check was the exact amount they had requested but they sent it back a month later and referred our mortgage for foreclosure anyways. We started to get many harassing calls from realtors.

I called PHH back to make sure they received the fax from the bank and I was told they did. I had to take XXXX hours off of work to have this done. On XXXX we received a letter stating that our XX/XX/XXXX payment hasn't been received and that our check was returned. I called PHH back and spoke with another relationship manager, XXXX. He told me that our payment had posted and our next payment due was XXXX and asked if I wanted to set up that payment. I told him I did so he tried to set it up and he kept getting an error. He told me to call back after XXXX or to mail our payment in. I mailed the payment in on XXXX. PHH has not cashed that check and on XXXX, we received a letter from them, with a copy of our XX/XX/XXXX payment ( dated XXXX ), stating that the check was being returned because it was not enough to cure our default. We have also started receiving calls from realtors again and PHH 's rep, XXXX XXXX has scheduled our home for foreclosure auction on XXXX. PHH is not allowing any online access to our account, they are not returning phone calls or emails. We started sending emails so we had proof of our attempts at trying to get answers and resolution to our account. PHH has referred our home for foreclosure 3 times when they shouldn't have. proper notice was not given by them, they will not send any statements or allow online account access and they will not speak with us or return calls and emails. PHH also had the wrong phone number listed on our account when it was transferred from Ocwen to PHH. They claimed to not be able to reach us via phone but the first time they referred our account to foreclosure, their rep XXXX XXXX, made public our correct private cell number on the foreclosure listing without our permission.

"In approximately the summer of 2017 I received a collection notice for over {$800.00} for a XXXX XXXX bill. I have never used XXXX XXXX ( my company phone is XXXX now, but even that is new this year ). I contacted the collection agency and advised them. They told me I needed to call XXXX. I did, and XXXX confirmed that whatever it was that was ordered was ordered using my social security number and my address but a different email address than any I have used. They said it was strange because it was a phone but the service was never activated. Further, that phone or whatever it was never was delivered to my home. They confirmed that it looked like fraud to them as well. They asked me if I could file a police report, but I pulled my credit report and given that it was the ONLY item on my credit report I felt that filing a police report wasn't going to get me anywhere. What would the police do for one item on my credit report with ZERO information about who might have done it to go on. So I simply advised XXXX that I wanted to dispute the account as it was not mine. 

Then they sold the debt to : JEFFERSON CAPITAL SYSTEM XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, MN I immediately notified them by mail that this was not my account, that XXXX KNEW this was not my account, and that it was the result of fraud. No response. They placed it on my credit report ( which XXXX never had ). I disputed it with all three bureaus and explained the situation in detail along with my dispute. 

They each did their investigation ( whatever that means ) and Jefferson Capital stood by their reporting.

Then i contacted my local police dept and filed a police report on XXXX for identity theft/fraud. Then i contacted XXXX XXXX and fought with them as they stated the name on the XXXX XXXX account was the same as mine, and that the ss # which they made me verify, was the same as mine. They explained the gentleman 's name was also the same as mine, and told me the acct was opened XXXX, and a women called and closed the XXXX acct out on XXXX. To make a long story short, XXXX XXXX verified the information that i had given to them, they also stated the acct holder had auto debit, and the bills were going to a women in Illinois, but yet they would not clear it.

"Opened an account for an Amazon credit card through Chase Bank in XX/XX/XXXX. Rarely used the card and closed the account in XX/XX/XXXX via phone.

Over the course of the next year I had at least 3 email and 3 phone conversations with Chase representatives after which in ALL cases they said the account would be closed and that the debt would be removed.

"The homeowner believes her consumer rights have been violated by the lender, XXXX XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXXthe homeowners loan was serviced by another lender. Under the 1st servicer the homeowner was considering to look into refinancing her home because her husband became ill and he was the household wage earner. However, due her spouses suddenness of his illness and later his death, she decided not to pursue the offer by 1st lender because the modification was at a higher interest rate than the current 7.875 %. However, the lender restructured mortgage by adding a deferred balance to the 1st mortgage. It appeared the lender added an erroneous deferred balance as a second mortgage lien. The homeowner continued to pay her mortgage. The homeowner never agreed to a modification or any consolidation that would cause a deferred balance to be added to the primary loan. Within the last 12 months, the homeowner had missed 5 months on her mortgage, but she requested a loan modification. Now the lender wants to combine the deferred payment with the mortgage balance. The homeowner was very reluctant to sign the loan modification, but was told by the Caliber Home Loan Servicer rep, that if she did not sign, foreclosure proceeding will begin in XX/XX/XXXX.

PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING FACTS : After transfers of the loan mortgage to two different servicers, Caliber Home Loans became the servicer of the mortgage. The homeowner made inquiries about the deferred balance to the new servicer. The servicer stated that it appeared to be attorney fees related to foreclosure proceedings. The homeowner stated that she had missed payments in the past when her husband became ill and died, but she caught the payments up. The representative stated that the reason for the lien of deferred payments attached to the mortgage to be attorney fees from the last servicer that held the loan. The homeowner stated that she nor her deceased husband signed any documents to receive a deferred balance.

In XX/XX/XXXX, the homeowner fell behind on the mortgage 3 payments, the homeowner submitted a Request for Modification application and supporting documentation. In the process of waiting for the underwriters decision, the homeowner called the customer service line to receive a status on her application, the Caliber Home Loans representative told the homeowner to send in {$2500.00} to receive a more favorable result in obtaining a loan modification. 
XX/XX/XXXX : On XX/XX/XXXX the homeowner obtained a cashier check and sent it to the servicer. The servicer sent the payment back to the homeowner. The homeowner then deposited the check back into her account. She called the servicer ; the representative stated that she needed to send the {$2500.00} to receive the approval from underwriting for the loan modification. Unknown to the homeowner, Caliber Home Loan sent in the mail correspondence dated XX/XX/XXXX that she was approved for a Trial Period Plan. The homeowner did not realize she had been approved, until she took all her paperwork to a HUD Approved Housing Counseling Agency. 
XX/XX/XXXX : The Certified HUD Counselor helped the homeowner comb through all the paperwork, then realized that a trial period plan had been approved. On XX/XX/XXXX, the counselor contacted the lender because the agreement had a 1st payment  of {$830.00} for the trial period plan dated for XX/XX/XXXX. The counselor requested on the behalf of the homeowner to have the {$2500.00} returned so that the homeowner could make the first trial period plan. The representative stated the payment had been set back on XX/XX/XXXX, and the homeowner should have it within in a day from the date of the call. The counselor stated it was important that the money is returned in order to make the trial period payments. 
XX/XX/XXXX : On XX/XX/XXXX, the counselor contacted Caliber Home Loans to follow-up regarding the returning of the {$2500.00}. The representative at Caliber Home Loans stated that the funds were sent back to the homeowner. The representative emphasized that the first payment of {$830.00} must be received by XX/XX/XXXX or the trial offer will be revoked. The counselor informed the homeowner of the need to send the 1st trial payment ASAP. The homeowner borrowed the money from a friend in order to send {$830.00} to the lender to ensure that she did not lose her home. 
XX/XX/XXXX : On XX/XX/XXXX the counselor spoke to Caliber Home Loans representative, XXXX ( employee # XXXX ). During the phone call the representative confirmed that the lender had received the payment of {$2500.00} and it was applied to all three of the trial period payments. Therefore, the lender had not sent the payment back to the homeowner as per their system and documented conversations with the client and counselor. The representative expressed that a permanent modification was approved on the spot. The counselor requested that the {$830.00} be returned to the homeowner so that she could use it as her 1st payment for the modification on XX/XX/XXXX. The rep stated that the payment would be sent back and the first payment would be due XX/XX/XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX : The homeowner went to the bank to determine if the cashier check for {$830.00} had been cashed. The bank validated that the lender did cash the check. 
XX/XX/XXXX : The homeowner received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX outlining the terms of the modified loan. The letter states the homeowner must send in with the signed agreement {$740.00}. There was no documentation of receipt the cashiers checks for {$2500.00} and {$830.00}. The summary of the terms stated the following : o Unpaid balance : {$100000.00} ( 1st lien mortgage and the deferred balance of {$25000.00} ) o Interest Rate : 3.5 % o Monthly payment : {$390.00} o Escrow payment : {$340.00} o First Modified Payment Date : XX/XX/XXXX o Maturity Date : XX/XX/XXXX The homeowner feels XXXX to the unexplained deferred balance that has no explanation by the lender. Caliber Home Loans refused to remove the deferred balance from the modified loan. The homeowner wanted to refuse the offer because 1 ) she believes the servicer applied the erroneous amounts to strip her from the equity in her home and diminishing any opportunity to refinance with another lender without incorporating the erroneous fee into the new mortgage. 2 ) the homeowner signed the loan modification, because she did not want to lose her home to foreclosure. 

The homeowner is requesting the CFPB to investigate the reason for the lenders applying the erroneous deferred balance to her loan. She believes she has a predatory loan, and the deferred balance was added to the loans in order for the lenders to strip the homeowner of the equity out of her home. She wants the deferred balance removed from the loan so that she can have an affordable modified loan at a lower interest rate.",Mortgage,"Caliber Home Loans, Inc.",2

"Events in chronological order : ( 1 ) I applied for a citibank credit card "" Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select card '' on XX/XX/2019, I was notified that the application was approved no later than XX/XX/2019.

( 4 ) Now today on XX/XX/2019 which is 12 days after the chat I still did not get my new card and I have to call customer support again to ask what happened and how to resolve the issue ( 5 ) After the agent verified all the information and about to place the order to resend the card she said "" sorry verification blocked because the account is of high fraudulent risk ''. I think it's really ridiculous and I don't trust the agent 's capability to resolve this issue promptly or smoothly so I am complaining to CFPB about the case. 

What I am complaining for : ( 1 ) It has been almost 1 month after the application is approved I am still far from receiving the actual credit card. 

( 2 ) I contacted Citibank several times but they failed to process the resending order. 

( 3 ) The agent said that it's because the address on my profile does not have apartment number. However I checked it again and again, my apartment IS on the profile. I did double check triple check. The agent changed her word after hearing this. 

( 4 ) The same thing happened to me more than once. Another very important communication from Citibank, which has a {$300.00} check was also not delivered to my address. 

( 5 ) I really don't understand that why my account was flagged as "" high risk of fraudulent ''. I don't even received my card!!! If that's the reason. This risk is totally brought by Citibank.

In XXXX, I called Westlake XXXX, the company who finances our car loan, to explain what had happened. They were at first, very understanding, told me not to worry and said that they would allow payments to be added on at the end of the loan term whilst the shutdowns were happening. What a relief, and exactly how you would hope a finance company would react to a global crisis. 
When I called to arrange the same thing in XXXX, they told me that was no longer an option. They told me that investors had 'put the pressure on ' to start collecting some payments, so they would have to take a payment for XXXX, on the premise that next month in XXXX we could do another deferral. I did not have the money - at this point it was very stressful and a case of do we eat, or do we pay our car payment? We struggled and cut back on food in order to make the payment, just so we could ensure we kept our car and at least we could then have the next month off. 

XXXX came along, and they started calling me 5 times a day ( at least ) to collect the payment. I explained that we'd arranged to defer the payment, and they told me this is no longer acceptable and every month 's payment has to be made. 

Unfortunately at the end of XXXX, things got so bad that we had to lose our home. The day after we'd moved out, I received another phone call from Westlake, where I explained that we'd lost our home the day before and we really need to find an arrangement for these payments. The person on the phone made no response whatsoever to me sharing this with him, all he could say was 'right ... so can you make a payment today? ' Having just lost our home, my level of XXXX XXXX was hanging by a thread and I must say, having someone respond like that pushed me over the edge for a second. 

Since then, they've been calling me multiple times a day starting at XXXX every day, sometimes from different phone numbers where they don't even tell me where they are calling from right away, which just feels so scammy. Just now, they called me again, and I told them I was making this complaint, and told them again the situation we are in, to which they again responded, 'right ...

I am just disgusted with this company.
